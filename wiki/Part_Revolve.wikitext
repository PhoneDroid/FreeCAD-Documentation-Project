==Description== <!--T:13-->

<!--T:2-->
Revolves the selected object around a given axis. The following shape types are allowed, and lead to the listed output shapes:

<!--T:4-->
A [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketch]] can be used as well. Solids or compound solids are not allowed as input shapes. Normal compounds are currently not allowed either.

{{Caption|Example of revolution}}

==Usage==

# Select the shape(s) in the [[3D_view|3D view]] or in the Model [[Tree_view|tree view]]
# Click on the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Revolve.svg|16px]] [[Part_Revolve|Part Revolve]]}} button in the toolbar, or go to the {{MenuCommand|Part → Revolve...}} menu
# Set the revolution axis and angle and optionally other parameters (see the following [[#Parameters|Parameters]] section for more details).
# Click {{Button|OK}}.

Alternatively, the selection can be done after launching the tool, by selecting one or more shape from the list in the [[Task_panel|Tasks panel]].

The Model tree will list as many Revolve objects as there were selected shapes. Each input shape is placed underneath its Revolve object.

== Parameters ==

The Revolve shape is defined by the following parameters, which can be edited after its creation in the [[Property_editor|Property editor]].  

*'''Source''': the input shape (the shape upon which the Part Revolve was applied).

*'''Base''': base point of revolution axis.

*'''Axis''': direction of revolution axis.

*'''Axis Link''': link to edge to use as revolution axis.

*'''Angle''': angle span of revolution. If angle is zero and an arc is used for axis link, arc's span will be used.

*'''Symmetric''': if True, revolution is extended symmetrically from the profile

*'''Solid''': if True, revolving a closed edge or a closed wire will yield a solid. If False, a shell will result.

*'''Face Maker Class''': sets C++ class name of face making code, which is used when making solids from wires. This property is here mainly for maintaining backward compatibility. Do not touch, unless you know what you are doing.

*'''Placement''': the standard [[Placement|placement]] parameters.

*'''Label''': label to be shown in the Model [[Tree_view|tree view]] (not available on Revolve creation).

== Task dialog == 

<!--T:5-->
[[Image:Dialog-revolve.png|thumb|right]]

* {{Button|OK}} button creates the revolution, and closes the dialog.

* {{Button|Cancel}} button closes dialog, without doing anything.

* Shape list: here you select, what shapes to revolve. If multiple objects are selected, multiple Revolve objects are created.

* 'Revolution axis' section: specify the revolution axis.
** Center X/Y/Z fields: set the base point of revolution axis.
** Dir. X/Y/Z fields: set the direction of revolution axis. Click a button to set the direction to corresponding axis.
** {{Button|Select reference}} button: click it, and then pick an edge in [[3D_view|3D view]]. That edge will appear in text field below the button, in format "ObjectName:EdgeN". You can also type the link manually or erase it. Values Dir. X,Y,Z will be filled according to the edge direction.

* Angle field: set angle of revolution in degrees.

* Symmetric angle: if checked, revolution wil extend forwards and backwards by half the specified angle.

* Create Solid checkbox: if checked, revolving a closed wire or edge will yield a solid. It is checked by default, if a closed wire was preselected before invoking Part Revolve.

==Notes== <!--T:14-->

<!--T:8-->
* The Angle argument specifies how far the object is to be turned. The coordinates move the origin of the axis of revolving, relative to the origin of the coordinate system.
* If you select a user defined axis, the numbers define the direction of the revolving axis with respect to the coordinate system: If the Z coordinate is 0 and the Y and X coordinate are non-zero, then the axis will lie in the X-Y-plane.  Its angle is such that its tangent is the ratio of the given X and Y coordinates.
* [[App_Link|App Link]] objects linked to the appropriate object types can also be used as shapes and to specify the axis. {{Version|0.20}}
* If the object to revolve intersects the rotation axis the operation will fail in most cases.
