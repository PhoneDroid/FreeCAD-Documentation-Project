== Description == <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
Calculates ship resistance by the Savitsky method. This method was formulated by Daniel Savitsky in 1964, with application to fast vessels in a planing regime.

<!--T:11-->
Plot the resistance curve, the equilibrium trim, the power prediction and the resistance coefficients. It also exports the results to a spreadsheet.

<!--T:17-->
This tool does not have a strict dependency on a '''Ship instance'''(see [[Ship_CreateShip|Ship CreateShip]]), which means that it is possible to use it introducing the necessary ship data values in the dialogue.

<!--T:18-->
It is also possible to use a '''Ship instance''' to execute the method
Until this point, all the tools in Ship workbench are based on a '''Ship instance''' (see [[Ship_CreateShip|Ship CreateShip]]), which only holds information regarding the ship shape. Following the progressive data introduction system, at this point the user might define load conditions, which involves creating weights with this tool, creating tanks (see [[Ship_Tank|Ship Tank]]) and assembling them in load conditions (see [[Ship_LoadCondition|Ship LoadCondition]]). With that information the center of gravity of the ship can be defined, enabling further computations.

== Usage == <!--T:19-->

<!--T:20-->
In order to create a weight, select the weight geometry (see below) and invoke {{MenuCommand|Weights → [[Image:Ship_Weight.svg|16px]] Create a new ship weight}}.

<!--T:21-->
The task panel is shown, where you must select the '''Ship instance''' (see [[Ship_CreateShip|Ship CreateShip]]) in which the weight shall be added, as well as the density/mass.

<!--T:22-->
When the {{Button|Accept}} button is pressed, a new weight entity is created inside the chosen '''Ship instance'''.
