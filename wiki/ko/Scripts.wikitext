== 소개 ==

스크립팅이란 FreeCAD의 Python 인터프리터를 사용하여 토폴로지 개체를 생성하는 것을 의미합니다. FreeCAD는 OpenSCAD의 "매우 좋은" 대체물로 사용될 수 있습니다. 주로 실제 Python 인터프리터가 있기 때문입니다. 즉, 실제 프로그래밍 언어가 내장되어 있기 때문에 GUI로 할 수 있는 거의 모든 작업을 Python Script로 수행할 수 있습니다.

안타깝게도 문서의 스크립팅에 대한 정보는 심지어 이 위키에도 흩어져 있고 "작성" 통일성이 부족하며 대부분이 너무 기술적인 방식으로 설명됩니다.

<span id="Getting_started"></span>
== 시작하기 ==

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
쉬운 스크립팅 방법의 첫 번째 장애물은 메뉴 항목이나 도구 모음 영역의 아이콘을 통해 FreeCAD 내부 Python 편집기에 직접 액세스할 수 있는 방법이 없다는 것입니다. 하지만 FreeCAD가 내부 Python 편집기에서 {{incode|.py}} 확장자를 가진 파일을 연다는 것을 알고 있으면 가장 간단한 방법은 즐겨 사용하는 텍스트 편집기에서 생성한 다음 일반적인 명령인 {{MenuCommand|File → Open)을 사용하여 여는 것입니다. }}.
</div>

To make the things in a polite way, the file has to be written with some order, FreeCAD Python editor have a good "Syntax Highlighting" that lacks in many simple editors like Windows Notepad or some basic Linux editors, so it is sufficient to write these few lines:

{{Code|code=
"""filename.py

   A short description of what the script does

"""
}}

Save them with a meaningfull name with {{incode|.py}} extension and load the resulting file in FreeCAD, with the said {{MenuCommand|File → Open}} command.

A minimal example of what is necessary to have in a script is shown in this portion of code that you could be use as a template for almost any future script:

{{Code|code=
"""filename.py

   First FreeCAD Script

"""

import FreeCAD
from FreeCAD import Placement, Rotation, Vector
import FreeCADGui

DOC_NAME = "Wiki_Example"
DOC = FreeCAD.newDocument(DOC_NAME)
FreeCAD.setActiveDocument(DOC.Name)

ROT0 = Rotation(0, 0, 0)
VEC0 = Vector(0, 0, 0)

# Helper function

def set_view():
    """Rearrange View."""
    if not FreeCAD.GuiUp:
        return
    doc = FreeCADGui.ActiveDocument
    if doc is None:
        return
    view = doc.ActiveView
    if view is None:
        return
    # Check if the view is a 3D view:
    if not hasattr(view, "getSceneGraph"):
        return
    view.viewAxometric()
    view.fitAll()
}}

Some tricks are incorporated in the above code:

* {{incode|import FreeCAD}} This line import FreeCAD in the FreeCAD Python interpreter, it may seem a redundant thing, but it isn't.
* {{incode|from FreeCAD import Placement, Rotation, Vector}} '''Placement''' '''Rotation''' and '''Vector''' are widely used in FreeCAD scripting, import them in this manner will save you to invoke them with {{incode|FreeCAD.Vector}} or {{incode|FreeCAD.Placement}} instead of {{incode|Vector}} or {{incode|Placement}}, this will save many keystrokes and make codelines much smaller.

Let's start with a small script that does a very small job, but display the power of this approach.

{{Code|code=
# Script functions

def my_box(name, len, wid, hei):
    """Create a box."""
    obj_b = DOC.addObject("Part::Box", name)
    obj_b.Length = len
    obj_b.Width = wid
    obj_b.Height = hei

    DOC.recompute()

    return obj_b

# objects definition

obj = my_box("test_cube", 5, 5, 5)

set_view()
}}

Write above lines of code after {{incode|# Script functions}} and press the green arrow in the '''Macro toolbar'''.

You will see some magic things, a new document is open named "Wiki_example" and you will see in the 3d view a [[Part_Box|Cube]], like the one in the image below.

[[File:Cubo.png|thumb|center|Test cube]]

== Something more ==

Not that amazing? Yes, but we have to start somewhere, we can do the same thing with a [[Part_Cylinder|Cylinder]], add these lines of code after the {{incode|my_box()}} function and before the line: {{incode|# objects definition}}.

{{Code|code=
def my_cyl(name, ang, rad, hei):
    """Create a Cylinder."""
    obj = DOC.addObject("Part::Cylinder", name)
    obj.Angle = ang
    obj.Radius = rad
    obj.Height = hei

    DOC.recompute()

    return obj
}}

Even here nothing too exciting. But please note some peculiarities:

* The absence of the usual reference to the {{incode|App.}}, present in many Documentation code snippets, is deliberate, this code could be used even invoking FreeCAD as a module in an external Python interpreter, the thing is not easily doable with an AppImage, but with some care it could be done. Plus in the standard Python motto that "better explicit than implicit" {{incode|App.}} is explaining in a very "poor" way where the things are from.
* Note the use of the "constant" name assigned to the active Document in {{incode|DOC &#61; FreeCAD.activeDocument()}}; activeDocument is not a "constant" in a strict sense, but in a "semantical" way is our "active Document", that for our use is a proper "constant" so the Python convention to use the "ALL CAPS" name for "constants", not to mention that {{incode|DOC}} is much shorten than {{incode|FreeCAD.activeDocument()}}.
* Every function returns a geometry, this will be clear in the continuation of the page.
* Geometry didn't have the {{incode|Placement}} property, when using the simple geometries to make more complex geometry, managing {{incode|Placement}} is a awkward thing.

Now what to do with this geometries?

Let's introduce boolean operations. As a starter example put these lines after {{incode|my_cyl}}, this create a function for a '''Fusion''' also know as '''Union''' operation:

{{Code|code=
def fuse_obj(name, obj_0, obj_1):
    """Fuse two objects."""
    obj = DOC.addObject("Part::Fuse", name)
    obj.Base = obj_0
    obj.Tool = obj_1
    obj.Refine = True
    DOC.recompute()

    return obj
}}

Nothing exceptional also here, note however the uniformity in function coding; This approach is more linear than those seen around other tutorial on scripting, this "linearity" help greatly in readability and also with cut-copy-paste operations.

Let's use the geometries, delete lines below the code section starting with {{incode|# objects definition}}, and insert the following lines:

{{Code|code=
# objects definition

obj = my_box("test_cube", 5, 5, 5)

obj1 = my_cyl("test_cyl", 360, 2, 10)

fuse_obj("Fusion", obj, obj1)

set_view()
}}

Launch the script with the green arrow and we will see in the 3D view something like:

[[File:Cucil.png|thumb|center|Cube and cylinder]]

== Placement ==

Placement Concept is relatively complex, see [[Aeroplane|Aeroplane Tutorial]] for a more deep explanation.

We usually are in need of placing geometries respect each other, when building complex object this is a recurring task, the most common way is to use the geometry {{incode|Placement}} property.

FreeCAD offer a wide choice of ways to set this property, one is more tailored to another depending the knowledge and the background of the user, but the more plain writing is explained in the cited Tutorial, it use a peculiar definition of the {{incode|Rotation}} portion of {{incode|Placement}}, quite easy to learn.

{{Code|code=
FreeCAD.Placement(Vector(0, 0, 0), FreeCAD.Rotation(10, 20, 30), Vector(0, 0, 0))
}}

But over other consideration, one thing is crucial, geometry '''reference point''', in other words the point from which the object is modeled by FreeCAD, as described in this table, copied from [[Placement|Placement]]:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
!Object!!Reference Point
|-
|Part.Box ||left (minx), front (miny), bottom (minz) vertex
|-
|Part.Sphere||center of the sphere
|-
|Part.Cylinder||center of the bottom face
|-
|Part.Cone||center of bottom face (or apex if bottom radius is 0)
|-
|Part.Torus||center of the torus
|-
|Features derived from Sketches||the Feature inherits the Position of the underlying Sketch. Sketches always start with Position = (0, 0, 0). This position corresponds to the origin in the sketch.
|}

This information has to be kept in mind especially when we have to apply a rotation.

Some examples may help, delete the {{incode|my_box}} function and all lines after the {{incode|my_cyl}} function, and add the code below after the {{incode|my_cyl}} function:

{{Code|code=
def my_sphere(name, rad):
    """Create a Sphere."""
    obj = DOC.addObject("Part::Sphere", name)
    obj.Radius = rad

    DOC.recompute()

    return obj

def my_box2(name, len, wid, hei, cent=False, off_z=0):
    """Create a box with an optional z offset."""
    obj_b = DOC.addObject("Part::Box", name)
    obj_b.Length = len
    obj_b.Width = wid
    obj_b.Height = hei

    if cent is True:
        pos = Vector(len * -0.5, wid * -0.5, off_z)
    else:
        pos = Vector(0, 0, off_z)

    obj_b.Placement = Placement(pos, ROT0, VEC0)

    DOC.recompute()

    return obj_b

def mfuse_obj(name, objs):
    """Fuse multiple objects."""
    obj = DOC.addObject("Part::MultiFuse", name)
    obj.Shapes = objs
    obj.Refine = True
    DOC.recompute()

    return obj

def airplane():
    """Create an airplane shaped solid."""
    fuselage_length = 30
    fuselage_diameter = 5
    wing_span = fuselage_length * 1.75
    wing_width = 7.5
    wing_thickness = 1.5
    tail_height = fuselage_diameter * 3.0
    tail_position = fuselage_length * 0.70
    tail_offset = tail_position - (wing_width * 0.5)

    obj1 = my_cyl("main_body", 360, fuselage_diameter, fuselage_length)

    obj2 = my_box2("wings", wing_span, wing_thickness, wing_width, True, tail_offset)

    obj3 = my_sphere("nose", fuselage_diameter)
    obj3.Placement = Placement(Vector(0, 0, fuselage_length), ROT0, VEC0)

    obj4 = my_box2("tail", wing_thickness, tail_height, wing_width, False, 0)
    obj4.Placement = Placement(Vector(0, tail_height * -1, 0), ROT0, VEC0)

    objs = (obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4)

    obj = mfuse_obj("airplane", objs)
    obj.Placement = Placement(VEC0, Rotation(0, 0, -90), Vector(0, 0, tail_position))

    DOC.recompute()

    return obj

# objects definition

airplane()

set_view()

}}

Let's explain something in the code:

* We have used a function to define a sphere, using the most easy definition, using only the radius.
* We have introduced a second writing for the '''Union''' or '''Fusion''', using multiple objects, not more distant from the usual '''Part::Fuse''' it uses '''Part:Multifuse'''. We only use one property {{incode|Shapes}}. We have passed a '''tuple''' as arguments, but it accepts also a '''list'''.
* We have defined a complex object '''airplane''', but we have done it in a '''"parametric"''' way, defining some parameters and deriving other parameters, through some calculation, based on the main parameters.
* We have used some Placement {{incode|Placement}} poperties around in the function and before returning the final geometries we have used a {{incode|Rotation}} property with the ''Yaw-Pitch-Roll'' writing. Note the last {{incode|Vector(0, 0, tail_position)}}, that define a '''center of rotation''' of the whole geometry.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| [[File:Aereo.png|thumb|left|Airplane example]] || [[File:Aereo2.png|thumb|center|Airplane rotated]]||
[[File:Aereo-prop.png|thumb|center|Placement property]]
|}

It can be easily noted that '''airplane''' geometry rotate around his "barycenter" or "center of gravity", that I've fixed at wing center, a place that is relatively "natural", but could be placed wherever you want.

The first {{incode|Vector(0, 0, 0)}} is the Translation vector, not used here, but if you substitute {{incode|airplane()}} with these lines:

{{Code|code=
obj_f = airplane()

print(obj_F.Placement)
}}

You will see in the Report window this text:

{{Code|code=
Placement [Pos=(0, -21, 21), Yaw-Pitch-Roll=(0, 0, -90)]
}}

What has happened?

FreeCAD has translated the {{incode|Vector(0, 0, 0), FreeCAD.Rotation(0, 0, -90), Vector(0, 0, tail_position)}} in other words our {{incode|Placement}} definition that specifies three components, '''Translation''', '''Rotation''' and '''center of rotation''' in the "internal" values of only two components, '''Translation''' and '''Rotation'''.

you can easily visualize the value of {{incode|tail_position}} using a print statement in the {{incode|airplane()}} function and see that it is:

{{Code|code=
tail_position = 21.0
}}

in other words the '''rotation center''' of the geometry is at {{incode|Vector(0, 0, 21)}}, but this rotation center is not shown in the GUI, it could be entered as a {{incode|Placement}} value, it could not be easily retrieved.

This is the meaning of the word "awkward" that I've used to define {{incode|Placement}} property.
