<span id="Usage"></span>
==용법==

# Select a base view for the detail view.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:TechDraw_DetailView.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_DetailView|Insert Detail View]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|TechDraw → TechDraw Views → [[Image:TechDraw_DetailView.svg|16px]] Insert Detail View}} option from the menu.
# A highlight outline is added to the base view, a detail view is added to the page, and a task panel opens.
# For clarity it is best to move the detail view so that it no longer overlaps the base view: hold down the left mouse button on its frame or label and drag it to a new position.
# To change the position of the highlight outline do one of the following:
#* Move the outline by dragging:
#*# Press the {{Button|Drag Highlight}} button.
#*# The outline is marked on the page and a temporary ''drag'' label is added.
#*# Hold down the left mouse button on the outline itself, or on that label, and drag the outline to a new position.
#* Move the outline by coordinate input:
#*# Change the X and Y coordinates in the task panel. The coordinates are relative to the center of the base view.
# Optionally change the '''Radius''' of the detail view.
# Optionally change the '''Scale Type''' and '''Scale Factor''' of the detail view. See [[TechDraw_View#Properties|TechDraw View]] for more information.
# Specify a '''Reference''' label. This label will be displayed near the highlight outline.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button.

==Notes==

* To edit a detail view double-click it in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
* The outlines of detail views can be round or square. This is controlled by the '''Detail View Outline Shape''' [[TechDraw_Preferences#Annotation|preference]].
* [https://www.forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=34055#p285281 Forum topic with a good discussion about setting the anchor.]
