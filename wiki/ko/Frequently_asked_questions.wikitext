<span id="What_is_the_easiest_way_to_install_FreeCAD_on_my_system?"></span>
=== FreeCAD를 내 컴퓨터에 설치하는 가장 쉬운 방법은? ===

If you are on Windows or macOS, the simplest way is to head to the [[Download|Download]] page, where you'll find several ready-to-install packages. If you are on Debian, Fedora or Ubuntu and some other distributions, FreeCAD is already included in the standard software repositories and you can simply install it with the software manager. On Ubuntu, the FreeCAD team also maintains its own [[Installing_on_Linux#Stable_PPA_version|PPA repositories]]. For further details about installation, refer to the installing page for your operating system ([[Installing_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Installing_on_Linux|Linux]] or [[Installing_on_Mac|Mac]]).

<span id="What_are_the_prerequisites_for_running_FreeCAD?"></span>
=== FreeCAD 실행을 위해 필요한 조건은? ===

In contrast to most 3D CAD software, FreeCAD can run smoothly on the most modest computers - it's been known to run on Pentium IV and Intel Core2 Solo CPUs. If your computer is running a current operating system, chances are FreeCAD will run. The only prerequisite is that your graphics card or chipset must support [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL OpenGL], preferably no older than v2.0. In case of problems, refer to the [[Frequently_asked_questions#Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] section of this FAQ.

==== Multithreading ====

FreeCAD's underlying geometric modeling kernel, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Cascade_Technology OpenCASCADE Technology] (OCCT) third-party library, [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=17501&p=173095&hilit=Multithread#p173095 has only partial multi-threading support at this time]. See the [[multithreading|multithreading]] page for more details.

<span id="What_if_I_want_to_compile_FreeCAD_myself?"></span>
=== FreeCAD를 내 스스로 컴파일하려면? ===

The source code of FreeCAD is always available in the project source code repository. Compiling FreeCAD yourself allows you to use the most recent features being developed, but requires a bit of computer knowledge, although the procedure is fairly simple. Access to the source code is explained [[Compile_on_Linux#Getting_the_source|here]], and we have detailed instructions for compiling on [[Compile_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Compile_on_Linux|Linux]] and [[Compile_on_MacOS|macOS]].

<span id="FreeCAD_tells_me_some_module_or_application_is_missing"></span>
=== FreeCAD가 나에게 어떤 모듈이나 응용프로그램이 없다고 합니다 ===

FreeCAD depends on a lot of things to offer all its functionality. All the main required components are usually bundled within your FreeCAD installation or provided by your package manager, so normally you have nothing to worry about. If you installed FreeCAD from unofficial sources, however, or compiled FreeCAD yourself, some piece might be missing, which is not critical to FreeCAD itself, but might cause some functionality to be unavailable. Some specific file formats such as Collada or DWG also require extra components, which cannot be bundled into FreeCAD, and must be installed by yourself separately. 

All those components and the appropriate way to install them are listed on the [[Extra_python_modules|Extra python modules]] page.

<span id="FreeCAD_doesn&#039;t_start_at_all"></span>
=== FreeCAD가 시작되지 않습니다 ===

There might be a lot of reasons for that, the most likely is that some library is missing. Try starting FreeCAD from a terminal (type {{SystemInput|freecad}} at a terminal prompt, {{SystemInput|FreeCAD}} on some systems) to see if some error message appears. Also, read the rest of this FAQ as it can give you more clues to detect the cause of the problem. If nothing helps, tell about it on the [http://forum.freecadweb.org/ forum], there will surely be someone who can help.

On some older Windows XP systems you may get an error message like this: {{Emphasis|The application can't start, because the side-by-side configuration is wrong. The reinstallation of the application may solve the problem.}} The reason for this problem is that on your system either the CRT runtime libraries are missing or the version installed is too old because FreeCAD was linked against a newer version. In this case you have to install the {{Emphasis|Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package}} which you'll find at Microsoft. See also the corresponding [http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1298&p=9961 forum message].

<span id="FreeCAD_starts_normally,_but_not_all_icons_are_displayed,_some_of_them_are_replaced_by_a_black_&#039;X&#039;"></span>
=== FreeCAD가 정상적으로 시작은 되었는데 모든 아이콘들이 보여지지 않고 일부는 'X'로 표시됩니다. ===

Some parts of FreeCAD depend on an external Python module called Pivy. On Windows, pivy is included in the FreeCAD installation. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, the python-pivy package is part of standard software repositories. On other systems, at the moment, you might have to compile pivy yourself. Note that although some tools are not available without pivy, the rest of FreeCAD works normally.

=== I have display problems, the 3D view doesn't behave correctly, there is garbage when I move/rotate the view, etc. ===

FreeCAD depends on OpenGL for displaying 3D contents, and therefore requires a working OpenGL environment. On some systems, OpenGL is not activated by default, and you might need to install or upgrade your graphics drivers. This problems happens most often on Linux systems or on virtual systems. If you are on a Linux-based system, try the following steps:
* verify that your computer has a 3D-capable graphics board
* type {{SystemInput|glxinfo}} in a terminal window, and check in the output that Direct Rendering is set to "yes", and that the OpenGL vendor/renderer/version matches your graphics card.
* install other OpenGL-based software ([http://www.blender.org Blender], for example) and check if it runs and displays correctly.

<span id="FreeCAD_crashes_on_startup"></span>
=== FreeCAD가 시작할 때 충돌합니다 ===

A crash might indicate a more serious bug, or some problem in your configuration. Most startup crashes occur because of one of the two following reasons:

<span id="OpenGL_drivers_are_not_installed,_or_not_working_properly"></span>
==== OpenGL 드라이버가 설치되지 않음, 또는 제대로 정상적으로 작동하지 않습니다 ====

This is a very common cause of the problem. The symptoms are simply that FreeCAD crashes at startup, or whenever you open a 3D view (for example by creating a new document). Try to find out what your graphic chip is, then find out if it supports [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL OpenGL] (most recent chips do), then find the correct driver and install it. A good way to doublecheck if OpenGL is available is to try to run another OpenGL application such as [http://www.blender.org blender].

And as a general tip to get some more information about crashes with FreeCAD you can start it with the program parameter {{SystemInput|--write-log}}. This will create the file {{FileName|FreeCAD.log}} in {{FileName|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/FreeCAD}} ({{VersionPlus|0.20}}) or {{FileName|$HOME/.FreeCAD}} ({{VersionMinus|0.19}}) on Linux, or {{FileName|$HOME/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD}} on macOS, or {{FileName|%APPDATA%/FreeCAD}} on Windows systems.

In some rare cases you may have a graphic driver installed that doesn't fit to your graphic card. We had a case where the user's laptop had an Intel on-board graphic but some ATI drivers were installed. Refer to forum thread in German [http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=5160&start=10#p41042 FreeCAD startet nicht]. After removing the files and re-installing the correct driver FreeCAD started to work.

<span id="Some_library,_needed_by_FreeCAD,_is_not_present_on_your_system,_or_wasn&#039;t_found_by_FreeCAD"></span>
==== FreeCAD에 필요한 어떤 라이브러리가 컴퓨터에 없거나 FreeCAD가 그것을 찾지 못했습니다 ====

There can be two paths to this problem: either some library is simply missing, therefore FreeCAD will refuse to start, or the library is there, but it is an older version than the one FreeCAD expects, so a crash will occur when FreeCAD attempts to use a missing feature from that library. A common example is when you have Qt3 and Qt4 installed on your system, FreeCAD might detect Qt4 but if your Qt installation is not properly configured, some pieces of Qt3 might still be used, provoking crashes.

Please review the installing procedure ([[Installing_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Installing_on_Linux|Linux]] or [[Installing_on_Mac|Mac]]), make sure you installed all the required libraries (on most linux systems this is done automatically), and check what is the minimum version number for each of the components.

If everything seems correct, describe the problem on the [http://forum.freecadweb.org/ forum] or [[Tracker|submit a bug]]. If you are on a linux system, it is easy to do a debug backtrace, which provides very useful information about the crash to the developers:
* in a terminal, type: {{SystemInput|gdb freecad}} (assuming package gdb is installed)
* inside gdb, type {{SystemInput|run}}
* after the crash, type {{SystemInput|bt}} to get the backtrace, that you can include in your bug report.

<span id="FreeCAD_freezes_after_startup"></span>
=== FreeCAD가 시작할 때 멈춥니다 ===

When starting FreeCAD the GUI appears almost immediately but the GUI is frozen and the cpu is about 99%. This can happen on the KDE desktop when using the Oxygen theme. That's a bug in the Oxygen theme and choosing another theme should fix this issue.

<span id="FreeCAD_crashes_on_creating_a_new_document_or_opening_a_file"></span>
=== 새 문서를 만들 때 또는 파일을 열 때 FreeCAD 가 충돌합니다 ===

If FreeCAD crashes when it creates a new 3D view, try launching FreeCAD from a terminal. If a message error appears when the crash occurs, mentioning {{SystemOutput|Assertion Failed}}, and a component name beginning with "So" ({{SystemOutput|SoBase}}, {{SystemOutput|SoFieldContainer}}, etc.), the chances are very high, especially if you are on Linux, that FreeCAD is trying to use two different versions of the Coin library, which causes the crash.
To verify if that is indeed the problem, try the following:
* Locate the FreeCAD executable (usually in {{FileName|/usr/lib/FreeCAD/bin}})
* Run the command {{SystemInput|ldd FreeCAD}} from a terminal
* Note down the version of the {{FileName|libCoin.so}} library that FreeCAD is using (for example {{FileName|libCoin.so.60}})
* Locate the {{FileName|libSoQt.so}} library (usually in {{FileName|/usr/lib}})
* run {{SystemInput|ldd libSoQt.so}} and check if it links to the same Coin version as FreeCAD
If there is any difference, either FreeCAD or SoQt must be recompiled (better to recompile the one that uses the oldest Coin version). The normal behavior is to try to contact the people responsible for packaging either SoQt or FreeCAD and kindly ask them to consider recompiling.
If you want to undertake that step for yourself, and it is not possible to recompile SoQt because it breaks other applications on your system, you can force FreeCAD to compile with the required Coin version with {{SystemInput|<nowiki>./configure --with-coin=DIR</nowiki>}}. But you have to make sure that the correct development package of this Coin version is installed.

<span id="FreeCAD_crashes_after_Edit_→_Alignment"></span>
=== 편집→정렬 이후 FreeCAD가 충돌합니다 ===

A segmentation fault happens at {{SystemOutput|vbo_save_playback_vertex_list()}}. This means that the implementation of VBO in the graphic driver is bad. In order to avoid caching OpenGL calls you can try to set the environment variable {{SystemInput|<nowiki>IV_SEPARATOR_MAX_CACHES=0</nowiki>}} and restart FreeCAD.

<span id="I_cannot_change_numeric_values_in_FreeCAD&#039;s_properties_panels"></span>
=== FreeCAD의 속성 패널에서 숫자 값을 변경할 수 없습니다 ===

[[File:Jj62l.png|480px|left|language options]]

You most likely have bad windows regional settings set-up. Please check if you have the same symbol for decimal separator and digit grouping symbol in your regional settings. If you do, [http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2655&p=20046#p20041 adapt your system settings] to use different characters for the digit grouping symbol and decimal separator. Note that it is not mandatory to have dot as decimal separator. It is mandatory to use different symbols in these two settings.

<span id="FreeCAD_was_running_normally,_and_suddenly_it_doesn&#039;t_start_anymore"></span>
=== FreeCAD가 정상적으로 실행되고 있었는데 갑자기 더 이상 시작되지 않습니다 ===

This can also happen if you had an older version of FreeCAD installed, and you upgraded to a newer version. In that process, the configuration files of FreeCAD might have been corrupted for some reason, and now FreeCAD cannot read them anymore, and fails to start. The solution is simply to delete these configuration files, so FreeCAD will recreate them on first run.

* On Windows: Open the file explorer, and write {{FileName|%APPDATA%\FreeCAD}} as the file path. Once there, delete the files {{FileName|user.cfg}} and {{FileName|system.cfg}}
* On Linux: Navigate to {{FileName|/home/USERNAME/.local/share/FreeCAD}} ({{VersionPlus|0.20}}) or {{FileName|/home/USERNAME/.FreeCAD}} ({{VersionMinus|0.19}}) and delete the files {{FileName|user.cfg}} and {{FileName|system.cfg}}
* On Mac: Navigate to {{FileName|/Users/USERNAME/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD}} and delete the files {{FileName|user.cfg}} and {{FileName|system.cfg}}

이제 FreeCAD는 모든 설정이 재설정되어 정상적으로 다시 시작됩니다.


There is a [[Macro_findConfigFiles|Macro findConfigFiles]] available to help in locating your configuration files. It can be installed using the Addon Manager in the Tools menu. {{MenuCommand|Tools → Addon Manager → Macros → findConfigFiles}}. The macro will find your config file folder, copy it to the clipboard, and (attempt to) open that location with your default file browser. It makes no changes to your files or settings.

There is a lot of documentation spread in different places, both on and outside the FreeCAD website. You might want to start with the [[Getting_started|Getting started]] page. The [[Tutorials|Tutorials]] section contains many specialized tutorial pages to help you getting started with the different workbenches. The [[Manual:Introduction|Manual:Introduction]] is a general, complete user-oriented guide to FreeCAD. The [[User_hub|User hub]] section of this wiki lists all pages aimed at end users. On external sites like [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=freecad Youtube], you will also find a load of video tutorials created by users. And, last but not least, the [https://forum.freecadweb.org forum] contains a lot of replies to questions asked by other newcomers.

<span id="How_do_I_extrude_stuff_into_solids?_I_don&#039;t_get_the_right_result"></span>
=== 어떻게 재료를 고체로 만들 수 있나요? 제대로 된 결과를 얻지 못했어요 ===

The theory is simple: Lines (or wires), when extruded, form faces. Faces, when extruded, form solids.

If you extrude something and the result is not a solid, then the something was not a face. If you have lines and you want to extrude a solid from them, you must first select lines that form a closed perimeter (select several objects by pressing {{KEY|Ctrl}}), join them into a wire ([[Draft_Upgrade|Draft Upgrade]] tool), then make a face from that wire ([[File:Draft_Upgrade.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Upgrade|Draft Upgrade]] tool again). There you are, if all went well you can now extrude it to a solid.

Now, there can be many little twists that make you obtain the wrong result. The best way to make sure is to check what's inside the object you are extruding. Objects contents can be easily explored with python. Assuming for example you have an object called "Wire", you could type this into the Python console:

{{code|code=
obj = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.Wire
shp = obj.Shape
print shp.Faces
print shp.Wires
if shp.Wires:
    for w in shp.Wires:
        print w.isClosed()
}}

The above code retrieves the shape from an object, shows the faces and wires your object has (if any), and, if there are wires, prints if those wires are closed. If you don't have any face, you won't get a solid. If there is no closed wire, it won't become a face. If you are interested, there is more info about what you can check with Python on the [[Topological_data_scripting|part scripting]] page. If you cannot join several lines into a wire, the most probable cause is that their endpoints don't meet, there must be small gaps between (some of) them. There, I'm afraid, my experience tells me the quickest way would be to redraw a wire on top of them.

<span id="My_boolean_operations_fail,_or_give_weird_results"></span>
=== 부울 연산이 실패하거나 결과가 이상하게 나옵니다 ===

Like all solid modeling kernels, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_CASCADE_Technology Open CASCADE] geometric modeling kernel used in FreeCAD for Part geometry, although probably the best open-source geometry kernel available, has flaws and limitations. Boolean operations (fusion, subtraction, intersection) are complicated operations, and often give strange results. This is a current limitation we have no way to solve at once, so your best path is to try obtaining the desired result by modeling another way. For example, problems with primitives such as cylinder can often be solved by using an extruded circle instead. Coplanar surfaces between parts can cause trouble, as well as surface tangency. As a general rule, if a shape doesn't work, try remodeling it a different way. In 99% of the cases at the end you will manage to obtain the result you want.

To understand boolean operations better, see these articles:

* https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/specification__boolean_operations.html#autotoc_md293

<span id="When_I_export_(or_view)_my_model,_the_holes_are_filled_in"></span>
=== 모델을 내보내거나 볼 때 구멍이 채워집니다 ===

Don't use {{KEY|Ctrl}} + {{KEY|A}} (Select All) to export everything from the hierarchy tree. If the model is of one single item, try selecting only the newest item (usually the last one) in the hierarchy tree.

As we create a model in the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]], each feature takes the shape of the last one and adds or removes something, creating linear dependencies from feature to feature as the model is created. Hence a "Cut" feature is not only the cut hole itself, but the whole part with the cut. This is why the user usually should only have the newest item (feature) in the model tree visible, because otherwise the phases of the model overlay each other, and holes are filled in by the earlier model features.

To toggle visibility of an object on or off, select it in the hierarchy tree and press {{KEY|spacebar}} on your keyboard. Usually everything but the last item in the hierarchy tree should be greyed out and therefore not visible in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

=== 기본 스케치를 수정하면 파라메트릭 개체가 파손됩니다 ===

여러분은 방금 유명한 위상명명 문제를 만났습니다.

This is a very hard problem to overcome (the [[Topological_Naming_Project|Topological Naming Project]] aims at solving it). However, there are many workarounds available to mitigate the problem, and more advanced users generally manage to avoid it completely. A couple of strategies are:

* Know that sketches are highly sensitive to the problem. Referencing a specific edge of a sketch, or a face of an object built on a sketch, such as a [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]], is dangerous, unless you are pretty confident that these sketches will not change over time or the sketch is very simple. A Pad built on a simple rectangular sketch, for example, will likely be safe as it will generate only one face, so there is no order problem.
* Prefer other kinds of objects such as [[Part_Workbench|Part]] or [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] when possible. These objects are always built the same way, and therefore their geometric components usually follow the same order each time they are rebuilt. They are much less susceptible to toponaming problems.
* To attach further objects onto the faces of sketch-based geometry, prefer using [[PartDesign_Plane|Datum geometry]]. These invisible "helper objects" don't depend on sketch geometry, and therefore stay stable over time.
