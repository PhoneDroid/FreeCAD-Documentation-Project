[https://forum.freecadweb.org The official FreeCAD forum] should be the premier place to ask questions and start discussions, As it will help preserve the experience and knowledge of the community.

A couple of areas that would welcome your work:
* The [[:Category:Command Reference]] page lists and documents all of the FreeCAD [[command|command]]s. Most of them contain little to no information at all. Please refer to [[WikiPages|WikiPages]] for good examples of what command documentation pages should look like.
* The [[Tutorials|Tutorials]] section needs examples on how to use the workbenches. If you developed something cool with FreeCAD, why not document how you did it for posterity? 
* There are open tickets on the FreeCAD [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues "bug tracker"] tagged [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adocumentation "documentation"] that could use some love.

=== FreeCAD 지식 공유 ===
The users community around FreeCAD is still small, but already includes several advanced users who do a very important job in showing to newcomers how to use the software. If you begin to feel comfortable with FreeCAD, your knowledge could be very valuable to others, and you might
contribute with important assets, like:
* Showing the work you do with FreeCAD on the [http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=24 Users Showcase forum]. You can post screenshots, and, even better, attach the FreeCAD files so other people can examine it and understand how you did it.
* Recording [http://www.youtube.com/user/FreeCADNews videos] showing how you did something interesting in FreeCAD. These videos usually do a great job in showing new features.
* Write [http://freecad-tutorial.blogspot.com/ tutorials] describing or teaching something interesting. You can write tutorials on your own blog, directly on our wiki, or even on the forum.
* Post on the [https://joinmastodon.org/ Mastodon] open source social network (and [https://fosstodon.org/@FreeCAD follow FreeCAD] there) or on the [https://www.facebook.com/groups/416491481766626 Facebook] community.

[[File:Bugreport-workflow.png|center]]
Although the place to report confirmed bugs and suggest new features is eventually the '''[[tracker|FreeCAD Tracker]]''', please always post bug reports and feature requests to the Help forum first. In order to save developers time (triaging and handling hard to understand bugs can be very time consuming), and avoid frustrations because your issue was not handled the way you would like, please read the following:
* Bugs and features requests are handled in the same tracker. Just mark your issue as "bug" (something that doesn't work as it should) or "feature" (something that is not there but you think it would be good to have)
* Although originally you could submit issues anonymously, unfortunately this had to be cancelled due to spam. Now if you would like to create/edit tickets you will have to create an account. You will then by default be notified when someone adds notes to the issue. In many cases, the person who will handle the bug will need more information from you.
* When reporting a bug, the most important point is to allow developers to reproduce it. Be sure to include the exact steps needed to make the bug happen, so another person can do the same and see the bug happen on his machine too. If the developer cannot see the bug, he cannot solve it either.
* Also include information that can help developers to situate the problem, like the operating system you are running FreeCAD on, the exact version of FreeCAD and the relevant libraries. Please post all the data by using the "copy to clip board" button in the Help (menu) → about FreeCAD dialogue, and do this from the Part or PartDesign workbench.
* No matter how sure you are that you have found a bug, please always discuss bugs first in the [http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=3 Help forum].
* Before submitting a feature request, always discuss it with other users first on the [http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=8 Open discussion forum], so you might end up with a more solid proposal, with more chances to interest a developer to implement it.
* Remember that FreeCAD is developed by volunteers who use their free time to work on it. Although everyone tries his best to make the best possible application, your bug report might be treated with low priority, or cancelled if you cannot give sufficient information, and your feature request might be postponed or even refused if no developer has interest in implement it or if that would request unrealistic amount of work.

== Triage bugs ==

There are dozens of bugs reported on [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues GitHub] weekly. It takes a lot of time to read them, categorize them, verify if the issue is reproducible, see if some easy actions can be done, or ask the person who posted the issue to provide more information. Helping to triage is easy, just head over the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues GitHub] and start commenting on any issue where you think you might be able to help!

Writing code for FreeCAD is not hard, and you don't need any permission, you can start right now to work on something you want, then submit a patch on the [http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker tracker] or request a merge from a [https://github.com/FreeCAD git branch]. To avoid headaches you should meet the following prerequisites first:
* FreeCAD goes at its own pace, and has a very small team of developers. We have not as much time as we would like to dedicate to FreeCAD, and things are not planned ahead; they are done when some developer sees it fit and when he finds time to do it. So we don't maintain a list of tasks to be done. It is up to you to find something you would like to do, for example a defect you would like to correct, or a small feature you think is missing. The [http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker tracker] also contains some items that are not yet assigned to anybody.
* Before you start to code for FreeCAD, you must know well how FreeCAD works. This seems obvious, but if you don't know how it is supposed to work you won't know what to do internally or how to do it.
* Almost everything can be done either in Python or C++. The internals work almost the same in both languages. We suggest you read through the [[Power users hub|Power users hub]] pages, even if you're going to code in C++, since it will give you a good overview of the internals.
* If you are going to work in C++, make sure you can compile FreeCAD without problems first.
* Present yourself to other developers. FreeCAD is before anything a social project, we discuss a lot of things on the [http://forum.freecadweb.org forum] before implementing it, and it's always best to discuss your ideas and tell people what you are planning to do before actually doing it. We also have an [irc://chat.freenode.net/freecad IRC channel], but the forum is the one and only place where you can meet all the developers.
* Since 2016, FreeCAD also participates in the [[Google Summer of Code|Google Summer of Code]]. Be sure to check our ideas there if you are interested in participating in a next edition.

* Since 2016, FreeCAD also participates in the [[Google_Summer_of_Code_2020|Google Summer of Code 2020]]. Be sure to check our ideas there if you are interested in participating in the next edition.
* More and more of the FreeCAD functionality is not written in the FreeCAD code itself but in addons, macros and extensions. Together, this ecosystem is what makes FreeCAD powerful. Oftentimes, working on an addon is easier because there is less code to read and understand, and fewer people involved. check the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons Addons repository] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros Macros repository] to get some ideas!

== Create models ==

FreeCAD features a [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library Models library] that is free and open to everyone. Why not add some useful parts there, that could be reused by others? Be sure to create models yourself from scratch, to keep the library 100% free of possibly copyrighted or non-free components.
