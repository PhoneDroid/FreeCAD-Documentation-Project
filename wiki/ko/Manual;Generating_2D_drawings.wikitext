만약 프리캐드에서 작업한 모형의 실재 크기가 너무 커서(예:건물) 기계로 직접 출력하거나 가공할 수 없는 경우, 또는 부품들이 준비된 후 수동으로 조립해야 하는 경우에는 일반적으로 다른 사람에게 조립 방법을 설명해야 합니다. 기술 분야(공학, 건축 등)에서는 일반적으로 도면을 사용하여 이를 수행합니다. 도면은 최종 제품 조립을 담당하는 사람에게 전달되어 조립 방법을 설명합니다.

대표적인 예로는 이케아 설명서, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_drawing 건축 도면], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint 청사진]이 있습니다. 이러한 도면에는 일반적으로 단지 그림뿐만 아니라 다른 사람들이 수행해야 할 작업과 방법을 이해하는 데 도움이 되는 글, 치수, 숫자 및 기호와 같은 많은 주석도 포함되어 있습니다.

프리캐드에서 이러한 도면을 만드는 데 필요한 작업대는 [[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_Workbench/ko|기술도면 작업대(TechDraw Workbench)]]입니다. 

기술도면 작업대를 사용하면 빈 시트를 만들거나 미리 만들어진 [[TechDraw_Templates/ko|템플릿]]을 사용하여 테두리 및 제목과 같은 일련의 항목이 시트에 이미 있는 시트를 만들 수 있습니다. 이러한 시트에서는 이전에 모델링한 3D 대상체의 보기(View)를 배치하고 이러한 보기가 시트에 어떻게 나타날지 구성할 수 있습니다. 또한 기술 도면에서 일반적으로 사용되는 치수, 글, 기타 기호 등 모든 종류의 주석을 시트에 삽입할 수 있습니다.

완성된 도면 시트는 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics SVG], PDF 또는 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF DXF] 파일로 인쇄하거나 내보낼 수 있습니다.

In the following exercise, we will see how to create a simple drawing of a chair model found in the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library FreeCAD library] (Industrial Design → Chairs → IkeaLikeChair). The FreeCAD library can easily be added to your FreeCAD installation (refer to the [[Manual:Installing|installing]] chapter of this manual), or you can simply download the model from the library webpage, or via the direct link provided at the bottom of this chapter.

[[Image:Exercise_TechDraw_01.png]]

* Load the IkeaLikeChair file from the library. You can choose between the .[[File_Format_FCStd|FCStd]] version, which will load the full modeling history or the .[[STEP|step]] version, which will create only one object, without the history. Since we won't need to model any further now, it is best to choose the .step version, as it will be easier to manipulate.

[[Image:Parts_library.jpg]]

* Switch to the [[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]]
* Press the [[Image:TechDraw_PageTemplate.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_PageTemplate|TechDraw PageTemplate]] button.
* Select the '''A4_Portrait_ISO7200TD''' template. A new tab will open in your FreeCAD window, showing the new page.
* In the [[tree view]] (or in the model tab), select the chair model. It will most likely be named something like "Open CASCADE STEP translator."
* Press the [[Image:TechDraw_View.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_View|TechDraw View]] button.
* A View object will be created on our page. Select the view object in the tree view, and then give the view the following [[TechDraw_View#Properties|properties]] in the data tab of the combo view:
**Under the Base category:
*** X: 70 mm
*** Y: 120 mm
*** Rotation: 0
*** Scale: 0.1
**Under the Projection category (hit the drop-down arrow to modify the x, y, and z components of these properties individually):
*** Direction: [0 0 1]
*** XDirection: [0 -1 0] (Change the y field first, then the x field)
* We now have a nice top view of our chair. Hit the [[Image:TechDraw_ToggleFrame.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_ToggleFrame|TechDraw ToggleFrame]] button to turn the View frames, labels, and vertices off.

[[Image:Exercise_drawing_02.jpg]]

* Let's repeat the operation twice, to create two more views. We will set their X and Y values, which indicate the position of the view on the page, in order to show them apart from the top view, and their direction, to create different view orientations. Give each new view the following properties:
** View001 (front view): X: 70, Y: 220, Scale: 0.1, Rotation: 0, Direction: (-1,0,0), XDirection: (0,-1,0)
** View002 (side view): X: 150, Y: 220, Scale: 0.1, Rotation: 0, Direction: (0,-1,0), XDirection: (1,0,0)
* After that, we obtain the following page:

[[Image:Exercise_TechDraw_04.png]]

* Note that there may be easier ways to get the views that you want. You can simply [[Manual:Navigating in the 3D view|rotate]] the 3D view of your model, and once you have the view you want, select the model in the tree view and hit [[Image:TechDraw_View.svg|16px]] New View. This will automatically insert a view with the desired rotation and direction properties. You can also use the [[Image:TechDraw_ProjectionGroup.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_ProjectionGroup|TechDraw ProjectionGroup]] tool.

* We can tweak the aspect of our views if we want, for example, we can change their '''Line Width''' property (under the View tab in the Combo View) to 0.5.

We will now place dimensions and indications on our drawing. There are two ways to add dimensions to a model: one is placing the dimensions inside the 3D model, using the [[Image:Draft_Dimension.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Dimension|Dimension]] tool of the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]], and then placing a view of these dimensions on our sheet with the [[Image:TechDraw_DraftView.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_DraftView|TechDraw DraftView]] tool. The other is to do things directly on the TechDraw sheet. We'll use the latter method.

* Hit the [[Image:TechDraw_ToggleFrame.svg|16px]] Toggle button to turn the vertices on.
* Use Ctrl + Left Mouse Click to select the two vertices you want to measure the distance between.
* Hit the [[Image:TechDraw_LengthDimension.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_LengthDimension|TechDraw LengthDimension]] button.

[[Image:Exercise_TechDraw_05.png]]

* Repeat the operation, until all the dimensions you wish to indicate are placed. Use the [[Image:TechDraw_VerticalDimension.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_VerticalDimension|TechDraw VerticalDimension]] and [[Image:TechDraw_HorizontalDimension.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_HorizontalDimension|TechDraw HorizontalDimension]] tools as necessary. 
* Take a minute to look at the [[TechDraw_LengthDimension#Properties|properties]] of the Dimension object in the Combo View.
* Please note that if you are dimensioning an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axonometric_projection axonometric] view (e.g., isometric view) instead of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiview_projection multiview] view (e.g., front view) as we have done here, you will need to use the [[Image:TechDraw_LinkDimension.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_LinkDimension|TechDraw LinkDimension]] tool to get an accurate dimension.

[[Image:Exercise_TechDraw_07.png]]

* We will now place the two callouts shown in the image above, using the [[Image:TechDraw_Balloon.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_Balloon|TechDraw Balloon]] tool.

[[Image:Exercise_TechDraw_06.png]]

# Looking at the Page in the [[3D_view|3D view]] window, select the View to which the Balloon will be attached, as shown in the image above.
# Press the [[Image:TechDraw Balloon.svg|16px]] Balloon button.
# The cursor is now displayed as a balloon icon.  Click on the page to place the balloon origin at the desired position.
# The balloon bubble may be dragged to the desired position. 
# Change the balloon properties by double-clicking the balloon label or the balloon object in the [[Tree_view|tree view]]. This will open the Balloon Task dialog. Set the Value field to the desired text and change the Symbol drop-down menu selection to {{MenuCommand|None}} 
# Press {{Button|OK}}
# Repeat the operation for the second callout.
* We will now fill in the sheet title block.
** Make sure that the View frames, labels, and vertices are visible. If not, hit the [[Image:TechDraw_ToggleFrame.svg|16px]] Toggle button.
** Edit the text in each section of the sheet title block by clicking on the small green square on the left side of the text.

Our page can now be exported to SVG for further work in graphical applications like [http://www.inkscape.org Inkscape] or to DXF. Select the page in the [[Tree_view|tree view]] and then select menu {{MenuCommand|File → Export}}. The DXF format is importable in almost all existing 2D CAD applications. TechDraw pages can also be directly printed or exported to PDF.
