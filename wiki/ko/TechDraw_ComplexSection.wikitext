== Description ==

The '''TechDraw ComplexSection''' tool inserts a cross-section view based on an existing part view and a profile.

== Usage ==

# Select a part view and a profile object in the [[3D_view|3D view]] or [[Tree_view|Tree view]]. Profiles are typically Sketches, but any object whose shape can be made into a wire will work.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:TechDraw_ComplexSection.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_ComplexSection|Insert Complex Section]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|TechDraw → TechDraw Views → [[Image:TechDraw_ComplexSection.svg|16px]] Insert Complex Section}} option from the menu.
# A task panel opens which will help calculate the various properties. Reasonable values for the view Direction are calculated, but these can be changed.

== Properties ==

A Complex Section, formally a {{Incode|TechDraw::DrawComplexSection}} object, is derived from a [[TechDraw_SectionView#Properties|Section View]], formally a {{Incode|TechDraw::DrawViewSection}} object, and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Cutting Tool}}

* {{PropertyData|Cutting Tool Wire Object}}: The document object whose shape will be used to generate the cutting profile.
* {{PropertyData|Projection Strategy}}: Controls how the cut is performed and how the result is projected on the page:
** {{Value|Offset}}: Performs a simple cut of the Source shape and projects the result.
** {{Value|Aligned}}: Cuts the Source shape using a tool created from each segment (edge) of the cutting profile. The results of each cut are projected in a vertical or horizontal array, depending on the orientation of the cutting profile.
** {{Value|NoParallel}}: As Aligned, but profile segments which are parallel to the view direction are skipped.

== Notes ==

See [[TechDraw_SectionView#Notes|TechDraw SectionView]]

== Scripting ==

See also: [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ Autogenerated API documentation] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

A Complex Section can be created with [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following functions:

{{Code|code=
doc = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument
box = doc.Box
profile = doc.Sketch
page = doc.Page

view = doc.addObject("TechDraw::DrawViewPart", "View")
page.addView(view)
view.Source = box
view.Direction = (0, 0, 1)

section = doc.addObject("TechDraw::DrawComplexSection", "ComplexSection")
page.addView(section)
section.BaseView = view
section.CuttingToolWireObject = profile
section.Direction = (0, 1, 0)
section.SectionNormal = (-1, 0, 0)
}}
