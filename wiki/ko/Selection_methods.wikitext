==개요==

[[Selection_methods|Selection methods]] in FreeCAD allow picking objects in the [[Interface|FreeCAD Interface]]: such as [[3D_view|3D view]], [[Tree_view|tree view]], [[Selection_view|selection view]], and other dialogs. Some selection methods are workbench specific and are documented in the particular workbench documentation.

==3D view==

In the [[3D_view|3D view]] there are various ways of selecting objects.

===Simple selection===

Simple selection with the mouse (by default left-click) and pre-selection (hover) are described in the [[Mouse_navigation|mouse navigation]] page.

===Repeated clicks===

The first click selects a sub-element (vertex, edge or face) of the object under the mouse. A second click selects the whole object.

The third click extends the selection to its container object ([[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]], [[Std_Part|Std Part]], and others). Further clicks expand the selection up the container chain.

===Selection commands===

* To select all objects: [[Std_SelectAll|Std SelectAll]].
* To box select multiple main objects: [[Std_BoxSelection|Std BoxSelection]].
* To box select multiple faces: [[Std_BoxElementSelection|Std BoxElementSelection]] or [[Part_BoxSelection|Part BoxSelection]].

==Selection view==

The [[Selection_view|selection view]] shows the names of the objects being selected, including their full name within an object, for example, {{incode|Unnamed#Body.Box001.Face17}}. 

It also allows to perform some actions like [[Std_ViewFitSelection|Std ViewFitSelection]], and sending the object to the [[Python_console|Python console]].

===Object export===

''This should be in the [[selection view]] page.''

Select any complex object, for example, a [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]] or [[Std_Part|Std Part]], then in the [[selection_view|selection view]] select again the object, and then press {{KEY|Ctrl}} + {{KEY|C}} in the keyboard to open the {{MenuCommand|Object selection}} dialog. This allows copying the selected object together with all or only some of that object's dependency objects. For example, for a [[Std_Part|Std Part]] the possible objects to select include the [[Std_Part|Std Part]] itself, but also its Origin, its three base axes (XYZ), and its three base planes (XY, YZ, XZ).

After pressing {{Button|OK}}, the selected objects are copied into memory, and then can be pasted in the document to duplicate these objects only.

==Tree view==

In the [[tree_view|tree view]] items can be selected, or deselected, one at a time, by holding the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key and clicking with the mouse.

A range of items can be selected by clicking on the first item, holding {{KEY|Shift}}, and clicking on the last item.

Selecting a single item will also show its properties in the [[property_editor|property editor]].

Double clicking will open any associated [[task_panel|task panel]] containing actions. Make sure to close this task panel before executing another command or switching to any other workbench.

More methods are available by opening the context menu (right-click), depending on the object selected or the active workbench; see the information in [[tree_view|tree view]].

==Scripting==

Selecting objects is inherently a graphical task and therefore it is only available when the graphical user interface is loaded.

These methods can be used in [[Macros|macros]] or from the [[Python_console|Python console]]:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCADGui as Gui

Gui.Selection.addSelection
Gui.Selection.addSelectionGate
Gui.Selection.Filter
}}

The {{incode|addSelectionGate}} method prevents the user from selecting objects not specified in the selection string. A [[Image:Button_invalid.svg|16px]] symbol appears when the pointer is over an item not in the specified group.

{{Code|code=
Gui.Selection.addSelectionGate("SELECT Part::Feature SUBELEMENT Edge")

#### or
Gui.Selection.addSelectionGate("SELECT Part::Feature SUBELEMENT Face")

#### or
Gui.Selection.addSelectionGate("SELECT Part::Feature SUBELEMENT Vertex")
}}

To remove {{incode|SelectionGate()}}:

{{Code|code=
Gui.Selection.removeSelectionGate()
}}

See the [[Source_documentation|Source documentation]] and [[Std_PythonHelp|Std PythonHelp]] for more help on using these tools.
