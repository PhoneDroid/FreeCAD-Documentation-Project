<span id="Introduction"></span>
== 소개 ==

The [[File:Workbench_Arch.svg|24px]] [[Arch_Workbench|Arch Workbench]] provides a modern [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Information_Modeling '''B'''uilding '''I'''nformation '''M'''odelling] (BIM) workflow to FreeCAD, with support for features like fully parametric architectural entities such as walls, beams, roofs, windows, stairs, pipes, and furniture. It supports [[Arch_IFC|'''I'''ndustry '''F'''oundation '''C'''lasses]] (IFC) files, and production of 2D floor plans in combination with the [[File:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]].

The Arch Workbench imports all tools from the [[File:Workbench_Draft.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]], as it uses its 2D objects to build 3D parametric architectural objects. Nevertheless, Arch can also use solid shapes created with other workbenches like [[File:Workbench_Part.svg|24px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part]] and [[File:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign]].

The BIM functionality of FreeCAD is now progressively split into this Arch Workbench, which holds basic architectural tools, and the [[File:Workbench_BIM.svg|24px]] [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]], which is available from the [[File:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. This BIM Workbench adds a new interface layer on top of the Arch tools, with the aim of making the BIM workflow more intuitive and user-friendly. See [https://yorik.uncreated.net/blog/2020-010-freecad-bim-guide FreeCAD BIM migration guide].

The developers of Draft, Arch, and BIM also collaborate with the greater [https://osarch.org OSArch community], with the ultimate goal of improving building design by using entirely free software.
