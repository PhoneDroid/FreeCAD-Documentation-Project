== Introduction == <!--T:7-->

<!--T:2-->
This tutorial is supposed to show how to import text or geometry created with inkscape via svg-format into FreeCAD.<br />
Inkscape 0.91 and FreeCAD 0.16.6704 on Windows are used for these operations.

== General tips for importing from inkscape == <!--T:8-->

<!--T:3-->
*the svg-import in FreeCAD cannot handle a svg file with a resolution of more than 45 dpi, so check the settings in inkscape
*when importing path objects which show up in the 3D view in FreeCAD not very smooth it may be a matter of the FreeCAD-settings for the shape view.
**in FreeCAD choose {{KEY|Edit}} → {{KEY|Preferences}} → {{KEY|Part Design}} → {{KEY|Shape View}}
**as for "Tesselation", the "Maximum deviation depending on the model bounding box" the default value is "0,5 %"
**setting this to a lower value will increase smoothness of the model in the 3D view (and use more PC performance)
**don't use values lower than "0,01 %", this will most likely crash FreeCAD
**in that case deleting "system.cfg" and "user.cfg" in your FreeCAD-user-directory will solve this problem

== Importing text from inkscape == <!--T:9-->

<!--T:4-->
*In inkscape, after inserting text (and perhaps applying effects like bending or something else to it) make sure to
**select your text and choose {{KEY|Path}} → {{KEY|Object to path}}
**ungroup your objects
**save as "Plain SVG (*.svg)" file format
*open the file in FreeCAD, choosing the option "SVG as geometry (importSVG)"
*a path object for each letter/number/sign will be created in the tree view
*use [[Draft_Upgrade|Draft Upgrade]] tool on each path object to create faces
*use pad or [[Part_Extrude|Part Extrude]] tool on the faces to get solids
*you can fuse your objects or use compound on them depending on your intended further work

== Importing geometry from inkscape == <!--T:10-->

<!--T:5-->
Since inkscape and FreeCAD seem to have different approaches on how to apply dimensions on svg-object, the recommended workflow seems to be:
*ungroup all objects in inkscape
*select all objects in inkscape
*apply a stroke style with a width of 0 mm (yes, that is zero millimeter) to all objects
*save as "Inkscape SVG (*.svg)" or "Plain SVG (*.svg)" file format
*open the file in FreeCAD, choosing the option "SVG as geometry (importSVG)"
*the dimensions of the objects in inkscape and in FreeCAD should now be identical
