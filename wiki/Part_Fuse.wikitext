== Description == <!--T:13-->

<!--T:2-->
The [[Image:Part_Fuse.svg|24px]] '''Part Fuse''' tool fuses (unites) selected Part objects into one. This operation is fully parametric and the components can be modified and the result recomputed.

<!--T:4-->
'''Note:''' This command is an automated form of the [[Image:Part_Boolean.svg|24px|link=Part_Boolean]] [[Part Boolean|Boolean operation]].

== Usage == <!--T:5-->

<!--T:18-->
# Select two or more shapes
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Fuse.svg|16px]] [[Part_Fuse|Fuse]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → Boolean → [[Image:Part_Fuse.svg|16px]] Fuse}} option from the menu.

== Supported inputs == <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
Input objects must be [[OpenCASCADE|OpenCASCADE]] shapes. Examples: stuff made with Part, PartDesign, Sketcher workbenches. Not meshes (unless those were converted to shapes) - for meshes, there are specific Boolean tools in MeshDesign workbench.

<!--T:9-->
* Solid + Solid: the result is a solid that occupies all the volume covered by the inputs

<!--T:10-->
* Shell + Shell, Shell + Face, Face + Face: the result is a shell. Where faces intersect, they are split. Shells can be non-manifold. After fusion, faces can be united by [[Part_RefineShape|Refining]] the result.

<!--T:11-->
* Wire + Wire, Edge + Wire, Edge + Edge: the result is a wire. Edges are split where they intersect. 

<!--T:12-->
Compounds are supported; however, it is assumed that shapes packed into a compound do not touch or intersect. If they actually do, Fusion will likely fail, or produce an incorrect result.

== Options == <!--T:19-->

<!--T:3-->
Items can be added and removed from a fusion, by dragging them in or out of the fusion feature in the tree view with the mouse. To drag items out of a fusion you have to drop them onto the document node (the filename) of your model. A manual recompute (press {{KEY|F5}} key or click on the [[Image:Std_Refresh.svg|24px]] [[Std_Refresh|Refresh/Recompute]] icon) is required to see the results.
