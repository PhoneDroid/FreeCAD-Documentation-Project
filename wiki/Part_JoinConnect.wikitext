==Description== <!--T:33--> 

<!--T:2-->
The [[Image:Part_JoinConnect.svg|24px]] '''Part JoinConnect''' tool connects the interiors of two walled objects (e.g. pipes). It can also join shells and wires.

</translate>

<translate>

==Usage== <!--T:34--> 

<!--T:4-->
# Select objects to be connected. The order of selection is not important, since the action of the tool is symmetric. It is enough to select one sub-shape of each object (e.g., faces). You can also select a compound containing all shapes to be connected, e.g. a [[Draft_OrthoArray|Draft OrthoArray]].
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_JoinConnect.svg|16px]] [[Part_JoinConnect|Connect objects]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → Join → [[Image:Part_JoinConnect.svg|16px]] Connect objects}} option from the menu.
# A Connect parametric object is created. Original objects are hidden, and the result of connecting is shown in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

==Properties== <!--T:35--> 

<!--T:38-->
{{TitleProperty|Connect}}

<!--T:6-->
* {{PropertyData|Objects}}: List of objects to be connected. Generally, at least two objects are needed, but a single compound containing the shapes to connect will do as well. (as of FreeCAD v0.17.8053, this property is not displayed in [[Property_editor|Property editor]], and can only be accessed via [[#Scripting|Python]]).
* {{PropertyData|Refine}}: Sets whether to apply [[Part RefineShape|Refine]] operation or not, to the final shape. The default value is determined by a 'Automatically refine shape after boolean operation' checkbox in [[PartDesign_Preferences|PartDesign Preferences]].
* {{PropertyData|Tolerance}}: "fuzziness" value. This is an extra tolerance to apply when searching for intersections, in addition to tolerances stored in the input shapes.

==Example== <!--T:36--> 

<!--T:7-->
# Create a pipe by applying [[Part_Thickness|thickness]] to a [[Part_Cylinder|cylinder]]: <br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step1.png|320px]]
# Create another, smaller diameter pipe, and [[Placement|place]] it so that it pierces the wall of the first pipe: <br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step2.png|320px]]
# Select the first pipe and the second pipe, and click the 'Connect objects' option from the Join tools dropdown toolbar button. <br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step3_Connect.png|320px]]
# Use some cross-section tool ([[Std_ToggleClipPlane|Clipping plane]], [[Arch_SectionPlane|Arch Section Plane]], [[Arch_CutPlane|Arch Cut Plane]]) to reveal internals. In the picture below, Arch Section Plane is used.<br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step4_Connect.png|320px]]

==Algorithm== <!--T:39-->

<!--T:8-->
The algorithms behind Join tools are quite simple, and understanding them is important to use the tools correctly. The algorithm of Connect, in particular, is quite a bit more complex than others, but it's generally enough to think of it as a symmetric variant of [[Part_JoinEmbed#Algorithm|Embed algorithm]]

<!--T:23-->
1. Each object is split into pieces by intersections with other objects. (see [[Part_BooleanFragments|Part BooleanFragments]]) 

<!--T:24-->
2. From the pieces of an object, only the largest one is kept; all the rest are thrown away.

<!--T:25-->
3. Intersection pieces that touch at least two objects are added to result. Then, the pieces are joined together to form the result of Connect.

===Notes=== <!--T:37--> 

<!--T:16-->
* If at step 1 each object remains in one piece, the result of Connect will be equivalent to [[Part_Fuse|union]] of Objects.
* Now, all compounds supplied are exploded prior to connecting. This means that self-intersecting compounds, which are invalid for all other Boolean operations, are valid for Connect. (This may be changed in the future.)
* The "largest" piece is the one that has largest mass. That is, for solids, volumes are compared; for shells and faces, areas are compared, and so on.
* Since FreeCAD v0.17.8053, and if OCC version is 6.9.0 and above, Connect is almost as fast as all other Boolean operations. For older versions, Connect is approximately 5 times slower than a regular Boolean operation, and works only on solids.

==Scripting== <!--T:17-->

<!--T:18-->
The Join tools can by used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python_console|Python console]] by using the following function:

</translate>
 '''BOPTools.JoinFeatures.makeConnect(name)'''
<translate>

<!--T:19-->
* Creates an empty Connect feature. The 'Objects' property must be assigned explicitly, afterwards.
* Returns the newly created object.

<!--T:26-->
Connect can also be applied to plain shapes, without the need to have a document object, via:

</translate>
 '''Part.BOPTools.JoinAPI.connect(list_of_shapes, tolerance = 0.0)'''
<translate>

<!--T:27-->
This can be useful for making custom Python scripted features.

<!--T:20-->
Example:

</translate>
{{code|code=
import Part
j = Part.BOPTools.JoinFeatures.makeConnect(name= 'Connect')
j.Objects = FreeCADGui.Selection.getSelection()
}}
<translate>

<!--T:21-->
The tool itself is implemented in Python, see {{FileName|/Mod/Part/BOPTools/JoinFeatures.py}} ([https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Part/BOPTools/JoinFeatures.py Github link]) under where FreeCAD is installed.
