== Introduction == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:2-->
The goal of this article is to list some currently missing features in FreeCAD and provide workarounds for them. It can be helpful for new users who can't find a particular functionality in FreeCAD.

== Workarounds for the Sketcher Workbench == <!--T:3-->

! width="2%"|No. !! width="28%"|Missing feature !! width="70%"|Workarounds

<!--T:5-->
|-
| 1
| Auto snap to objects (geometric centers, quadrants, extensions, intersections)
|
* Manually apply [[Sketcher_Workbench#Sketcher_constraints|constraints]] and use [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction lines]]
* Draw geometry in the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]], where snapping to objects is available, then convert to sketch with the [[Draft_Draft2Sketch|Draft Draft2Sketch]] tool

<!--T:14-->
|-
| 2
| Check geometric and mass properties of the sketch (area, center of mass, second moments of area and so on)
|
* Create a face from the sketch with [[Part_MakeFace|Part MakeFace]], then analyze that face with [[Part_CheckGeometry|Part CheckGeometry]]

<!--T:15-->
|-
| 3
| Possibility to use the results of the [[Sketcher_External|External Geometry]] tool directly for operations on the sketch
|
* Manually trace over the geometry created by this tool
* [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases Link Branch] - Defining Geometry tool

<!--T:16-->
|-
| 4
| Project multiple edges at once with the [[Sketcher_External|External Geometry]] tool when a face is selected
|
* Project edges individually

<!--T:17-->
|-
| 5
| 3D sketches
|
* Use the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]], but 3D drafts can't be converted to sketches (however, they can be used for spatial frame analyses done [[FEM_Workbench|internally]] or externally, and for [[PartDesign_AdditivePipe|PartDesign AdditivePipe]] or [[Part_Sweep|Part Sweep]] paths)

<!--T:18-->
|-
| 6
| Projection of cut edges when making a sketch on a plane cutting through an object
|
* Create a [[Std_LinkMake|Link]] from the object, and [[Part_SliceApart|slice]] that object to get actual cut edges

<!--T:19-->
|-
| 7
| [[Sketcher_ViewSection|View section]] tool showing filled cuts
|
* If the sketch is plane-parallel to one of the main planes of the global coordinate system: use [[Part_SectionCut|Part SectionCut]]

<!--T:91-->
|-
| 8
| Diameter dimension with respect to a symmetry axis for revolved parts
|
* Create a radius dimension instead (you can enter the diameter divided by 2 - the calculation will be handled by FreeCAD)

<!--T:113-->
|-
| 9
| Dimension labels adapting to the rotation of the view to be always readable
|
* Rotate the view when needed

<!--T:114-->
|-
| 10
| First [[Sketcher_Workbench#Dimensional_constraints|dimension]] in the sketch scaling the geometry so that its initially drawn shape is not broken
|
* Apply some [[Sketcher_Workbench#Dimensional_constraints|dimensional constraints]] before drawing the entire shape

<!--T:115-->
|-
| 11
| An option to hide the whole [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction geometry]] in an active sketch
|
* In the Elements window, use the ''Construction'' filter, select the [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction geometry]] entities there and uncheck their checkboxes

<!--T:20-->

<!--T:22-->
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! width="2%"|No. !! width="28%"|Missing feature !! width="70%"|Workarounds

<!--T:23-->
|-
| 1
| Check the geometric and mass properties of the model
|
* [[Macro_FCInfo|FCInfo macro]]

<!--T:24-->
|-
| 2
| Display the center of mass of the model (part or assembly)
|
* [[Macro_CenterOfMass|Macro CenterOfMass]]

<!--T:25-->
|-
| 3
| [[Std_ToggleClipPlane|Clipping plane]] that doesn't make the model look like it's hollow
|
* Change the Lighting property in the part's view settings to "One side" (very rough equivalent, problem with multicolored parts)
* [[Part_SectionCut|Persistent section cut]] tool - deselect all planes before pressing Close
* [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases Link Branch] - experimental renderer

<!--T:26-->
|-
| 4
| Creation of an axis on the intersection of 2 planes and a plane midway between two faces/points, possibly more variants for [[Datum|datum]] creation
|
* [[Macro_Intersection|Macro Intersection]]
* Manual adjustment of [[Datum|datum]] attachment

<!--T:27-->
|-
| 5
| Automated midsurface extraction (for thin-walled parts)
|
* Use [[Draft_Facebinder|Draft Facebinder]] and then [[Draft_Scale|Draft Scale]] or [[Part_Offset|Part Offset]] (easier) to make it actual midsurface, apply the workaround for extending faces if the generated midsurfaces are separated and join them with boolean tools

<!--T:28-->
|-
| 6
| Project (map/wrap) sketches on non-planar (e.g. cylindrical) faces
|
* [[Curves_SketchOnSurface|Curves SketchOnSurface]] tool in add-on [[Curves_Workbench|Curves Workbench]]

<!--T:30-->
|-
| 7
| Select which part of the sketch to [[PartDesign_Pad|pad]]
|
* Select one by one all edges forming a closed contour to pad
* Select edges from the sketch and create a [[Std_LinkMakeRelative|SubLink]] or a [[PartDesign_SubShapeBinder|SubShapeBinder]] and pad that new object
* [[PartDesign_Pad|Pad]] a complete sketch located on the existing face of the model in the opposite direction (towards the existing shape) so that only new faces are created. Then it is possible to select these faces individually and pad them. This method should be used with caution since unnecessary 3D operations may lead to unexpected errors. Thus, it is recommended to use the previous workaround instead.
* [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases Link Branch] - Export Single Geometry and Export Multiple Geometries tools or automatic [[PartDesign_SubShapeBinder|SubShapeBinder]] created when edges forming a closed loop are selected from the sketch before [[PartDesign_Pad|padding]]

! width="2%"|No. !! width="28%"|Missing feature !! width="70%"|Workarounds

<!--T:96-->
|-
| 1
| Snap to apparent intersections of curved edges, perpendicular extensions, arc extensions, geometric centers and tangent points
|
* Use the other available [[Draft_Workbench#Draft_Snap_toolbar|Draft Snap tools]] and a more manual approach with construction geometry

<!--T:97-->
|-
| 2
| Keyboard shortcuts for [[Draft_Workbench#Draft_Snap_toolbar|Draft Snap tools]]
|
* Snaps can be activated and deactivated using keyboard shortcuts but only when none of the input boxes in the task panel has the focus (so the user should click in an empty space of the task panel to be able to use shortcuts for snaps)

<!--T:98-->
|-
| 3
| Automatically change the colors of objects back to 'normal' when removing them from the [[Draft_ToggleConstructionMode|construction geometry group]]
|
* Move the objects to a [[Draft_Layer|layer]] with the correct color settings
* Change the colors manually

<!--T:99-->
|-
| 4
| An option to quickly switch between the three main working planes and their projections at the selected point (for 3D drafting)
|
* Set the [[Draft_SelectPlane|Draft working plane]] to Automatic, and then select any of the standard views: [[Std_ViewFront|front view]], [[Std_ViewTop|top view]], etc.
* Use the [[Draft_Constrain|Draft Constrain]] feature - snaps to axes, not to planes
* Use [[Draft_WorkingPlaneProxy|working plane proxies]]

<!--T:101-->
|-
| 5
| AutoCAD-like command line input
|
* Use FreeCAD's widgets or [[Scripting_and_macros|Python scripting]] for input

<!--T:102-->
|-
| 6
| [[Draft_Hatch|Hatch]] a region enclosed by wires
|
* Create a face (a hatch can only be applied to objects with planar faces):
** In case of a single closed wire: set its Make Face property to "true", and its Display Mode to "Wireframe"
** [[Draft_Upgrade|Upgrade]] multiple wires two or three times until you have a face, or a single closed wire (see above)
** If the wires must stay separate, but are connected end-to-end, create a [[PartDesign_SubShapeBinder|SubShapeBinder]] from them 
** Trace over the region with a closed wire (not parametric)

*# Use the [[Draft_Shape2DView|Draft Shape2DView]] tool to create a 2D line representation of the view or section view
*# Use the [[Draft_Workbench#Drafting|Drafting]] tools with proper [[Draft_Workbench#Draft_Snap_toolbar|snaps]] to modify the view
*# Use the [[Draft_Draft2Sketch|Draft Draft2Sketch]] tool to create a sketch out of the Draft objects

<!--T:105-->
|-
| 10
| Auxiliary views
|
* Create a [[TechDraw_View|standard view]] from the correct direction. Workarounds for "View normal to a face" may help. Rotate and position the view as needed.
