== Introduction ==

The goal of this article is to list some currently missing features in FreeCAD and provide workarounds for them. It can be helpful for new users who can't find a particular functionality in FreeCAD.

== Workarounds for the Sketcher Workbench ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! width="2%"|No. !! width="28%"|Missing feature !! width="70%"|Workarounds

|-
| 1
| Auto snap to objects (midpoints, geometric centers, quadrants, extensions, intersections)
|
* Manually apply [[Sketcher_Workbench#Sketcher_constraints|constraints]] and use [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction lines]]
* Draw geometry in the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]], where snapping to objects is available, then convert to sketch with the [[Draft_Draft2Sketch|Draft Draft2Sketch]] tool
* Midpoint snap is available within the [[Sketcher_Snap|Sketcher Snap]] option but doesn't apply any constraints

|-
| 2
| Chamfer tool
|
* Make chamfers on the part level (after the sketch has been turned into a solid) with [[PartDesign_Chamfer|PartDesign Chamfer]] or [[Part_Chamfer|Part Chamfer]]
* Create a [[Sketcher_CreateFillet|fillet]], change the arc to [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction geometry]] and then connect the points with a [[Sketcher_CreateLine|line]] to create a chamfer
* Draw chamfers manually with [[Sketcher_CreateLine|lines]] or [[Sketcher_CreatePolyline|polylines]]

|-
| 3
| Circular pattern
|
* Create circular patterns on the part level (after the sketch has been turned into a solid):
** For a [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] Feature use [[PartDesign_PolarPattern|PartDesign PolarPattern]]
** For a [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] shape, or a complete [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]], use [[Draft_PolarArray|Draft PolarArray]] or [[Draft_CircularArray|Draft CircularArray]]
* Use [[Draft_PolarArray|Draft PolarArray]], then convert back to sketch with the [[Draft_Draft2Sketch|Draft Draft2Sketch]] tool
* Position sketch features in a circular pattern manually, vertices of a [[Sketcher_CreateRegularPolygon|polygon]] with a number of sides corresponding to the number of circular pattern instances or [[Sketcher_Symmetry|symmetry]] with respect to radially positioned [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction lines]] can make it easier

|-
| 4

* [[Part_Offset2D|Part Offset2D]] tool ([[PartDesign_SubShapeBinder|SubShapeBinder]] necessary for use in a [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]])
* [[Draft_Offset|Draft Offset]] tool ([[PartDesign_SubShapeBinder|SubShapeBinder]] necessary for use in a [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]])
* Draw offset geometry manually, [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction lines]] connecting the original and offset geometry and [[Sketcher_ConstrainPerpendicular|perpendicular]] to them at different locations, dimensioned with [[Sketcher_ConstrainDistance|distance dimension]] will ensure proper relation between the geometries

|-
| 5
| Rotate tool
|
* To rotate the whole sketch: change its Placement property
* To rotate a selection inside the active sketch:
*# Remove constraints that prevent the rotation, e.g. with [[Sketcher_RemoveAxesAlignment|Sketcher RemoveAxesAlignment]]
*# Optionally add constraints between the objects to be rotated
*# Apply an appropriate [[Sketcher_ConstrainAngle|Sketcher ConstrainAngle]] constraint or drag a vertex of one of the objects

|-
| 10

|-
| 12
| Project multiple edges at once with the [[Sketcher_External|External Geometry]] tool when a face is selected
|
* Project edges individually

|-
| 13
| 3D sketches
|
* Use the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]], but 3D drafts can't be converted to sketches (however, they can be used for spatial frame analyses done [[FEM_Workbench|internally]] or externally, and for [[PartDesign_AdditivePipe|PartDesign AdditivePipe]] or [[Part_Sweep|Part Sweep]] paths)

|-
| 14
| Projection of cut edges when making a sketch on a plane cutting through an object
|
* Create a [[Std_LinkMake|Link]] from the object, and [[Part_SliceApart|slice]] that object to get actual cut edges

|-
| 15
| [[Sketcher_ViewSection|View section]] tool showing filled cuts
|
* If the sketch is plane-parallel to one of the main planes of the global coordinate system: use [[Part_SectionCut|Part SectionCut]]

| Rectangle from 3 corners and rectangle from 3 points by center tools
|
* Use the currently available [[Sketcher_CreateRectangle|rectangle from 2 opposite corners]] and [[Sketcher_CreateRectangle_Center|rectangle from center]] tools and apply proper constraints afterwards

|-
| 17
| Diameter dimension with respect to a symmetry axis for revolved parts
|
* Create a radius dimension instead (you can enter the diameter divided by 2 - the calculation will be handled by FreeCAD)

|-
| 18
| Curved slot tool
|
* Draw curved slots manually
* Use one of the macros and scripts listed [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=72235 here]

|-

|
* Rotate the view when needed

|-
| 20
| First [[Sketcher_Workbench#Dimensional_constraints|dimension]] in the sketch scaling the geometry so that its initially drawn shape is not broken
|
* Apply some [[Sketcher_Workbench#Dimensional_constraints|dimensional constraints]] before drawing the entire shape

|-
| 21
| An option to hide the whole [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction geometry]] in an active sketch
|
* In the Elements window, use the ''Construction'' filter, select the [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction geometry]] entities there and uncheck their checkboxes

|}

* [[PartDesign_Pad|Pad]] a complete sketch located on the existing face of the model in the opposite direction (towards the existing shape) so that only new faces are created. Then it is possible to select these faces individually and pad them. This method should be used with caution since unnecessary 3D operations may lead to unexpected errors. Thus, it is recommended to use the previous workaround instead.

|-
| 3
| Automatically change the colors of objects back to 'normal' when removing them from the [[Draft_ToggleConstructionMode|construction geometry group]]
|
* Move the objects to a [[Draft_Layer|layer]] with the correct color settings

| An option to quickly switch between the three main working planes and their projections at the selected point (for 3D drafting)
|
* Set the [[Draft_SelectPlane|Draft working plane]] to Automatic, and then select any of the standard views: [[Std_ViewFront|front view]], [[Std_ViewTop|top view]], etc.
* Use the [[Draft_Constrain|Draft Constrain]] feature - snaps to axes, not to planes
* Use [[Draft_WorkingPlaneProxy|working plane proxies]]

|-
| 5
| Remove one arrow from a [[Draft_Dimension#Usage_radial_dimension|radial dimension]]
|
* Add a line with an arrow:
*# Create a [[Draft_Line|Draft Line]] from the center of the arc or circle to a point on its edge

|
* Create broken views manually:
*# Sketch two wavy or zig-zag lines close to the ends of a long part and [[Part_Extrude|extrude]] them towards the model creating surfaces for the cut
*# Use the [[Part_Slice|Part Slice]] tool to cut the model with these surfaces
*# Hide the middle piece and [[Std_TransformManip|move]] one of the remaining pieces towards the other
*# Create a [[TechDraw_View|view]] of these objects
*# If needed, make the lines of the cut dashed (using the [[TechDraw_DecorateLine|TechDraw DecorateLine]] tool)
*# If lines of the cut have to be extended, create a [[TechDraw_View|view]] of the sketch used in the first step and align it with the cut
*# To obtain a proper value of the length of the cut part, you can either change the dimension value manually (after enabling the ''Arbitrary Text'' option) or [[TechDraw_LinkDimension|link]] it to the distance between the end vertices of the original part

|-
| 7
| Exclude ribs from hatching
|
* In some cases it might be sufficient to use the first workaround mentioned here and manually create a section with a custom cutting line

|-
| 8
| Export of TechDraw pages as PDF without making the text from the template (path text) unmarkable/unsearchable.
|
* Export the page as SVG. Then convert the SVG to PDF by using e.g. [http://www.inkscape.org Inkscape] or open the SVG in a web browser and then save or print as PDF.

|-

|
* Select objects manually, one by one (while holding Ctrl)

|-
| 10
| Modify regular and section views using sketching tools

*# If a section view has to be modified, use the [[Part_SectionCut|Part SectionCut]] tool or boolean operations to cut the part in the same way as it would be done by the [[TechDraw_SectionView|section view]] tool
*# Use the [[Draft_Shape2DView|Draft Shape2DView]] tool to create a 2D line representation of the view or section view
*# Use the [[Draft_Workbench#Drafting|Drafting]] tools with proper [[Draft_Workbench#Draft_Snap_toolbar|snaps]] to modify the view
*# Use the [[Draft_Draft2Sketch|Draft Draft2Sketch]] tool to create a sketch out of the Draft objects
*# Use the [[Sketcher_ValidateSketch|Sketcher ValidateSketch]] tool to make sure that the sketch has no missing coincidences, doubled lines and so on (those issues may impact the face selection in TechDraw)
*# Use the [[TechDraw_View|TechDraw View]] tool to create a view of the sketch in TechDraw.

|-
| 11
| Auxiliary views
|
* Create a [[TechDraw_View|standard view]] from the correct direction. Workarounds for "View normal to a face" may help. Rotate and position the view as needed.

|-
| 11
| Analyses with 2D (plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric) elements
|
