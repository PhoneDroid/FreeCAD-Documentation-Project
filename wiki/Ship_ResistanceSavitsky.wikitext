== Description ==

Calculates ship resistance by the Savitsky method. This method was formulated by Daniel Savitsky in 1964, with application to fast vessels in a planing regime.

Plot the resistance curve, the equilibrium trim, the power prediction and the resistance coefficients. It also exports the results to a spreadsheet.

=== Resistance graph ===

The resistance is represented in kN, as a function of speed in knots. It includes the total resistance, the total resistance and the pressure resistance.

=== Trim graph ===

The equilibrium trim is represented in degrees, as a function of speed in knots.

=== Power graph ===

The power is represented in kW, as a function of speed in knots. It includes the effective power and the break power.

=== Coefficients graph ===

The resistance coefficients are adimensional, they are represented as a function of speed in knots. It includes the effective power and the break power.

=== Exported Spreadsheet Data ===

The spreadsheet contains the values of different variables for each evaluated speed, separated by columns.

== Application limits ==

It must be taken into account that the obtained results represented in the graphs must be inside the application limits of the method. 

The application limits of the Savitsky method are:  
<center>
<math> 1.0 \leq C_V \leq 13.0 </math>  

<math> 2.0^\circ \leq \tau \leq 15.0^\circ </math>  

<math> \lambda \leq 4.0 </math>  
</center>
Where:  

* <math>C_V</math> is the velocity coefficient, defined by the following expression:  
<center>
<math> C_V = \frac{V}{\sqrt{gB}} </math>  
</center>
* <math>\tau</math> is the trim angle of the vessel.  
* <math>\lambda</math> is the dynamic length-to-beam ratio, defined by the following expression:  
<center>
<math>\displaystyle \lambda = \frac{L_K + L_C}{2B}</math>
</center>

== Usage ==

This tool does not have a strict dependency on a '''Ship instance'''(see [[Ship_CreateShip|Ship CreateShip]]), which means that it is possible to use it introducing the necessary ship data values in the dialogue.

=== Using ship geometry ===

In order to execute the method, select a '''Ship instance''' and invoke {{MenuCommand|Resistance → [[Image:Ship_ResistanceSavitsky.svg|16px]] Resistance Savitsky prediction}}. 

The ship data will be obtain from the ship and the user only needs to enter the boundary conditions.
Data obtained from the vessel can be edited.

=== Using ship data ===

In order to introduced the ship data manually execute the method, invoke {{MenuCommand|Resistance → [[Image:Ship_ResistanceSavitsky.svg|16px]] Resistance Savitsky prediction}} and fill the dialogue fields.
