== Description == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
Calculates ship resistance by the Savitsky method. This method was formulated by Daniel Savitsky in 1964 [1], with application to fast vessels in a planing regime.

<!--T:5-->
Plots the resistance curve, the equilibrium trim, the power prediction and the resistance coefficients. It also exports the results to a spreadsheet.

=== Resistance graph === <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
The resistance is represented in kN, as a function of speed in knots. It includes the total resistance, the total resistance and the pressure resistance.

=== Trim graph === <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
The equilibrium trim is represented in degrees, as a function of speed in knots.

=== Power graph === <!--T:11-->

<!--T:12-->
The power is represented in kW, as a function of speed in knots. It includes the effective power and the break power.

=== Coefficients graph === <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
The resistance coefficients are adimensional, they are represented as a function of speed in knots. It includes the effective power and the break power.

=== Exported Spreadsheet Data === <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
The spreadsheet contains the values of different variables for each evaluated speed, separated by columns.

== Application limits == <!--T:18-->

<!--T:19-->
It must be taken into account that the obtained results represented in the graphs must be inside the application limits of the method.

<!--T:20-->
The application limits of the Savitsky method are:

</translate>
<math> 1.0 \leq C_V \leq 13.0 </math>

<math> 2.0^\circ \leq \tau \leq 15.0^\circ </math>

<math> \lambda \leq 4.0 </math>
<translate>

<!--T:21-->
Where:

<!--T:22-->
* <math>C_V</math> is the velocity coefficient, defined by the following expression:<br><math> C_V = \frac{V}{\sqrt{gB}} </math>
* <math>\tau</math> is the trim angle of the vessel.
* <math>\lambda</math> is the dynamic length-to-beam ratio, defined by the following expression:<br><math>\displaystyle \lambda = \frac{L_K + L_C}{2B}</math>

== Usage == <!--T:23-->

<!--T:24-->
This tool does not have a strict dependency on a '''Ship instance'''(see [[Ship_CreateShip|Ship CreateShip]]), which means that it is possible to use it introducing the necessary ship data values in the dialogue.

=== Using ship geometry === <!--T:25-->

<!--T:26-->
In order to execute the method, select a '''Ship instance''' and invoke {{MenuCommand|Resistance → [[Image:Ship_ResistanceSavitsky.svg|16px]] Resistance Savitsky prediction}}.

<!--T:27-->
The ship data will be obtain from the ship and the user only needs to enter the boundary conditions. Data obtained from the vessel can be edited.

=== Using ship data === <!--T:28-->

<!--T:29-->
In order to introduced the ship data manually, invoke {{MenuCommand|Resistance → [[Image:Ship_ResistanceSavitsky.svg|16px]] Resistance Savitsky prediction}} and fill the dialogue fields.
