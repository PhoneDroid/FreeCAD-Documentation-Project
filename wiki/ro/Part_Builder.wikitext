==Description==

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
==Descriere==
A tool to create more complex shapes from various parametric geometric primitives.
</div>

<span id="Usage"></span>
<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
==Use==
This tool will let you create shapes by creating
#Edge from two vertices
#Face from vertices
##Select vertices bounding the face in the 3D view
##Select if face should be planar
##Click on {{KEY| Create}}
##Object will be created in 3D view and will be listed in tree view
#Wire from edges {{Version|0.18}}##Select a set of adjacent edges in the 3D view
##Click on {{KEY| Create}}
#Face from edges
##Select a closed set of edges bounding the face in the 3D view
##Select if face should be planar
##Click on {{KEY| Create}}
##Object will be created in 3D view and will be listed in tree view
#Shell from faces
##Select faces in the 3D view
##Select if the shape should be refined
##Select if all faces should be included in shell
##Click on {{KEY| Create}}
##Object will be created in 3D view and will be listed in tree view
#Solid from shell
##Select if the shape should be refined
##Click on {{KEY| Create}}
##Object will be created in 3D view and will be listed in tree view
</div>

This tool can create the following objects: 

===Edge from two vertices===

#Select two vertices
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
[[Image:Edge from verts-1.gif]]

===Wire from edges=== 

#Select a set of adjacent edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
[[File:Wire_from_edges-1.gif]]

===Face from vertices===

#Select vertices bounding the face in the [[3D_view|3D view]]
#Select if face should be planar
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
#Object will be created in [[3D_view|3D view]] and will be listed in [[Tree_view|tree view]]
[[File:Face_from_verts.gif]]

===Face from edges===

#Select a closed set of edges bounding the face in the [[3D_view|3D view]]
#Select if face should be planar
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
#Object will be created in [[3D_view|3D view]] and will be listed in [[Tree_view|tree view]]
[[File:Face_from_edges.gif]]

===Shell from faces===

#Select faces in the [[3D_view|3D view]]
#Select if the shape should be refined
#Select if all faces should be included in shell
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
#Object will be created in [[3D_view|3D view]] and will be listed in [[Tree_view|tree view]]

===Solid from shell===

#Select if the shape should be refined
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
#Object will be created in [[3D_view|3D view]] and will be listed in [[Tree_view|tree view]]

==Notes==

==Note==
Un posibil flux de lucru ar putea fi:
*Draw a wireframe-model of your shape using the tools in the draft-workbench (for example line and dwire)
*Create all faces with "face from edges"
*Create a "shell from faces"
*Create a "solid from shell"
</div>
