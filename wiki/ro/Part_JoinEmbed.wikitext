==Descriere==

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
Instrumentul de încorporare încorporează un obiect cu pereți (de exemplu, o țeavă) într-un alt obiect cu pereți.
</div>

<span id="Usage"></span>
<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
== Cum se folosește ==
</div>

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
# Select the base object first, then the object to be embedded. The order of selection is important. It is enough to select one sub-shape of each object (e.g., faces).
# Invoke the Part JoinEmbed command.
</div>

==Properties==

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
==Properties==
{{TitleProperty|Base}}
* {{PropertyData|Base}}: Reference to base object (the one the other object is to be embedded into). The object should be a single solid.
* {{PropertyData|Tool}}: Reference to tool object (the object to be embedded). The object can be a single solid, or a [[Part MakeCompound|valid compound]] of solids.
* {{PropertyData|Mode}}: The mode of operation, equals 'Embed' (Changing that will transform the tool into another Part_JoinXXX). The value of 'bypass' can be used to temporarily disable the long computations (a compound of Base and Tool will be created, which is a fast operation).
* {{PropertyData|Refine}}: Sets whether to apply [[Part RefineShape|Refine]] operation or not, to the final shape. The default value is determined by a 'Automatically refine shape after boolean operation' checkbox in PartDesign preferences. When Mode property is 'bypass', Refine is ignored (never applied).
</div>

==Example==

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
==Example==
# Create a pipe by applying [[Part_Thickness|thickness]] to a [[Part_Cylinder|cylinder]]:<br />[[Image:JoinFeatures_Example_step1.png|320px]]
# Create another, smaller diameter pipe, and [[Placement|place]] it so that it pierces the wall of the first pipe:<br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step2.png|320px]]
# Select the first pipe, then the second pipe (order of selection is important), and click the 'Embed object' option from the Join tools dropdown toolbar button. <br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step3_Embed.png|320px]]
# Use some cross-section tool ([[Std_ToggleClipPlane|Clipping plane]], [[Arch_SectionPlane|Arch Section Plane]], [[Arch_CutPlane|Arch Cut Plane]]) to reveal internals. On the picture below, Arch Section Plane is used.<br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step4_Embed.png|320px]]
</div>

==Algorithm==

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
==Algorithm==
The algorithms behind Join tools are quite simple, and understanding them is important to use the tools correctly.
</div>

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
1. Base object is [[Part Cut|boolean-cut]] with Tool object. The resulting shape is a set ([[Part MakeCompound|compound]]) of non-intersecting solids (typically, two).
</div> 

2. The resulting compound is filtered: only the largest solid is kept.

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
3. That largest solid is [[Part Union|boolean-fused]] with Tool object.
</div>

4. If Refine property is true, the resulting shape is [[Part RefineShape|refined]].

===Notes===

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
===Notes===
* If after step 1, the object remains in one piece, the result of Embed will be equivalent to [[Part Union|union]] of Base and Tool, but taking longer to compute.
* Now, the tool will produce unexpected result, if a compound is supplied as Base. This may be changed in the future.
* Because the largest piece is determined by comparing volumes of pieces, the tool can only work with solids. This may be changed in the future.
</div>

<span id="Scripting"></span>
==Script==

The Join tools can by used in [[macros]] and from the python console by using the following function:

{{Code|code=JoinFeatures.makePartJoinFeature(name = 'Embed', mode = 'Embed')}}

* Creates an empty Embed feature (or other Join feature, depending on mode passed). The properties Base and Tool must be assigned explicitly, afterwards.
* Returns the newly created object.

Exempluː

{{code|code=
import JoinFeatures
j = JoinFeatures.makePartJoinFeature(name = 'Embed', mode = 'Embed' )
j.Base = FreeCADGui.Selection.getSelection()[0]
j.Tool = FreeCADGui.Selection.getSelection()[1]
}}

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
The tool itself is implemented in Python, see /Mod/Part/JoinFeatures.py under where FreeCAD is installed.
