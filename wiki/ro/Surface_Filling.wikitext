==Descriere==

{{Button|[[File:Surface_Filling.svg|16px]] [[Surface_Filling|Surface Filling]]}} creates a surface from a series of connected boundary edges. The curvature of the surface can be additionally controlled by non-boundary edges and vertices, and a support surface.

The base geometry can belong to curves created with the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] or the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]], but can also belong to solid objects such as those created with the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] or the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].

<span id="Usage"></span>
<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
== Cum se folosește ==
</div>

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
# apăsați butonul {{KEY|[[File:Filling.svg|24px]] '''Surface filling...'''}} button.
# Detalierea pașilor este necesară.
# Definiți opțiunile și apăsați {{KEY|OK}}.
</div>

<span id="Options"></span>
== Opţiuni ==

* In the {{MenuCommand|Boundaries}} section a support surface and boundary edges can specified:
** Press the {{Button|Support surface}} button and select a face in the [[3D_view|3D view]] to add a support surface.
*** Click the [[File:Edit-cleartext.svg|16px]] icon to remove the support surface.
** Press the {{Button|Add edge}} button once to start selecting boundary edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
** There are several ways to deselect boundary edges:
*** Press the {{Button|Remove edge}} button once to start deselecting edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
*** Select an edge in the list and press {{KEY|Delete}}.
*** Right-click an edge in the list and select {{MenuCommand|Remove}} from the context menu.

* In the {{MenuCommand|Edge constraints}} section non-boundary edges can be specified:
** The selection options are similar to those for boundary edges.

* In the  {{MenuCommand|Vertex constraints}} section non-boundary vertices can be specified:
** The selection options are similar to those for boundary edges.

* Press {{KEY|Esc}} or the {{Button|Cancel}} button to abort the operation.

== Example ==

The {{MenuCommand|Support surface}} acts as an additional constraint for the surface. The following simple example will give you an idea how this works:

# In the [[File:Workbench_Part.svg|16px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] create a [[File:Part_Cylinder.svg|16px]][[Part_Cylinder|cylinder]] and set its {{PropertyData|Angle}} to {{Value|180°}}.
# Switch to the [[File:Workbench_Surface.svg|16px]] [[Surface_Workbench|Surface Workbench]] and press the {{Button|[[File:Surface_Filling.svg|16px]] [[Surface_Filling|Filling]]}} button.
# Select the two semi-circular edges and the two straight edges that connect them.
# The result matches the four boundary edges, but the inner shape is quite different from the cylindrical face.
# Edit the Surface object and for the {{MenuCommand|Support surface}} select the cylindrical face.
# The modified shape matches the cylindrical face much more closely.

==Proprietăți==

A [[Surface_Filling|Surface Filling]] ({{incode|Surface::Filling}} class) is derived from the basic [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class, through the {{incode|Part::Spline}} subclass), therefore it shares all the latter's properties.

In addition to the properties described in [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]], the Surface Filling has the following properties in the [[Property_editor|property editor]].

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Filling}}

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
* {{PropertyData|Property}}: descrierea proprietăților
* {{PropertyView|Property}}: descrierea proprietăților
</div>

=== View === 

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyView|Control Points|Bool}}: it defaults to {{FALSE}}; if set to {{TRUE}}, it will show an overlay with the control points of the surface.

== Scripting ==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

The Surface Filling tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by adding the {{incode|Surface::Filling}} object.
* The edges to be used to define the surface must be assigned as a [[FeaturePython_Custom_Properties#App::PropertyLinkSubList|LinkSubList]] to the {{incode|BoundaryEdges}} property of the object.
* Auxiliary edges and vertices must be assigned as a [[FeaturePython_Custom_Properties#App::PropertyLinkSubList|LinkSubLists]] to the {{incode|UnboundEdges}} and {{incode|Points}} properties of the object.
* All objects with edges need to be computed before they can be used as input for the properties of the Filling object.
