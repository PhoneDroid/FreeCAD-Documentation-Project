==Raytracing Workbench==

{{VeryImportantMessage|The [[Raytracing_Workbench|Raytracing workbench]] is being superseded by the new [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render Render Workbench], which is intended as its replacement. The Render Workbench can be installed through the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. The information here is provided because by default FreeCAD is still shipped (as of 0.19-24276) with the Raytracing Workbench, and because the new module should basically work in the same way}}

=== Introducere ===
This tutorial is meant to introduce the reader to the basic workflow of the Raytracing Workbench, as well as most of the tools that are available to create a rendered image.
</div>

== Requirements ==
* FreeCAD version 0.16 or above
* [http://www.povray.org/ POV-Ray] and/or [https://luxcorerender.org/ LuxRender] is installed on the system
* In the case of POV-Ray, it's not enough to have just the binary executable in place, but it also '''''requires''''' the installation of '''''supporting files'''''. In Ubuntu, these are provided by the Recommends-flagged package [https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=povray-includes povray-includes]. Potential issues have also been seen with Linux installations requiring local configuration files to be manually created in a user's home folder, as discussed [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=27548&start=10#p224576 here].
* In the case of POV-Ray, installation of  [https://github.com/psicofil/Macros_FreeCAD psicofil's macro] is recommended
* The reader has the basic knowledge to use the Part and PartDesign Workbenches

== Procedure == 

=== Modeling ===
In this example a Cube is used as the study object, but models created in the Part or PartDesign Workbenches can be used instead.

# Create a new document
# Activate the Part Workbench
# Create a Cube. You are free to change its properties in any way.

Now we have a model with which to work.

=== Preparing for the render ===
# Switch to the Raytracing Workbench
# Change your View to '''Perspective'''. Go to '''View''' menu and select '''Perspective'''.
# Set the location for the renderer. Go to the '''Edit''' menu and select '''Preferences'''. Click on '''Raytracing''' and set the location to the executable. 
# Set the size of the rendered image. Go to the '''Edit''' menu and select '''Preferences'''. Click on '''Raytracing''' and set the desired image size.

==== POV-Ray ====
# Select  [[Image:Raytrace_New.svg|32px]] [[Raytracing_New|New PovRay project]]. From the dropdown menu pick '''RadiosityNormal'''

==== LuxRender ====
# Select [[Image:Raytrace_Lux.svg|32px]] [[Raytracing_Lux|New LuxRender project]]. From the dropdown menu pick '''LuxClassic'''

=== Setting the camera position ===
# Position the '''3D View''' to the desired location and distance from the model. In this case we will use the '''Axonometric View'''.
# Select the '''Project Folder''' from the '''Tree View'''
# Select [[Image:Raytrace_ResetCamera.svg|32px]] [[Raytracing_ResetCamera|Reset camera]]

=== Importing the model ===
# Select the model to render.
# Select [[Image:Raytrace_NewPartSegment.svg|32px]] [[Raytracing_InsertPart|Insert part]]

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
====  Running the Renderer ====
# Select  [[Image:Raytracing_Render.png|32px]] [[Raytracing_Render|Render]].
# Set the path to which the image will be stored.
# Wait for the rendering to finish. This may take a while.
</div>

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
==== Viewing the results ====
FreeCAD will immediately open the image after the render is finished.
</div>

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
We are now finished with the basic workflow for the [[Raytracing_Workbench|Raytracing Workbench]].
