==Description== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:11-->
The '''Defeaturing''' tool is intended for removal of selected features from the model. In this context, features are meant as holes, protrusions, gaps, chamfers, fillets etc. found on the model.

<!--T:12-->
The defeaturing tool can be very useful in different contexts:

<!--T:13-->
* To edit an imported solid where no history of operations is available.
* Fixing defects in the model, e.g. filling gaps, holes etc.
* Model simplification for numeric analysis, display on mobile devices, etc.

<!--T:14-->
The removed features are filled by the extension of the adjacent faces, thus no unexpected parts should appear in the result. Please note that the result is a new shape that is not linked to the original; thus, it is non-parametric.

<!--T:15-->
To be available, this tool requires FreeCAD to be based on Open Cascade 7.3.0 or greater. If it is not available in your version of FreeCAD, you may have a look at the [[Defeaturing_Workbench|Defeaturing Workbench]] add-on, which proposes similar functionality even with older versions of OCC or FreeCAD.

==Usage== <!--T:4-->

<!--T:16-->
# Select the face(s) to be removed from the model.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Defeaturing.svg|16px]] [[Part_Defeaturing|Defeaturing]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_Defeaturing.svg|16px]] Defeaturing}} option from the menu.
# A '''Defeatured''' object is created and the original object hidden.
