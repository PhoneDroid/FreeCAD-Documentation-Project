Development of FreeCAD 1.0 began after tagging [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/0.21 FreeCAD 0.21] on 2 August 2023. During development it was referred to as 0.22dev. FreeCAD 1.0.0 was released on Nov. 19 2024.

=== Minimum supported library versions ===

The development of 1.0 targets Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as the oldest OS for compiling FreeCAD. The minimum supported infrastructure software versions are therefore the ones of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:
* Boost 1.71
* GCC 7.5
* Clang 6.0
* CMake 3.16
* Python 3.8
* Qt 5.12
* OpenCASCADE 7.3
* VTK 6.3

This version of FreeCAD is compiled requiring the C++17 standard, and all C++17 features are allowed with two exceptions:
* std::filesystem is not well-supported by GCC 7.5 -- continue to use boost::filesystem instead
* std::regex is much slower than boost::regex in some important cases, so we will continue to include the Boost regex library
