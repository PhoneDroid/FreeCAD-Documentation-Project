==Description==

The [[Image:Curves_DraftAnalysis.svg|24px]] '''Curves DraftAnalysis''' tool creates a colored overlay on an object to visualize draft angles.

==Usage==

# Select one or more shapes.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Curves_DraftAnalysis.svg|16px]] [[Curves_DraftAnalysis|Draft Analysis]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Surfaces → [[Image:Curves_DraftAnalysis.svg|16px]] Draft Analysis}} option from the menu.
# A '''DraftAnalysis''' object is created for each selected shape.

==Notes==

* With this tool you can check if an object could be die cast in general and in connection with reflect lines determine the parting line for the die cavities, like in the above image. The tool direction runs through the poles of the sphere and its equator is the parting line. In this case the color ranges above and below the parting line can be considered separate analyses of both halves.
* If this tool is applied to an object representing a die then one range analyses how well a cast item would detach from the die while the other highlightes the regions that would obstruct the ejection of the item (undercuts).
* The angles should be set according to manufacturing process and material chosen for the selected item. For example:
**   {{PropertyView|Draft Angle1+2}}: The minimum required angle that would still result in proper parts if other settings of the manufacturing process are fine-tuned and monitored.
** {{PropertyView|Draft Tol1+2}}: Added on top of the required angle giving the minimum recommended angle that will result in proper parts and a stable manufacturing process under any circumstance without further action.
* The colors:
** {{PropertyView|Color In Draft1+2}}: Marks areas with draft angles larger than the recommended angle.
** {{PropertyView|Color In Tolerance1+2}}: Marks areas with draft angles between the required angle and the minimum recommended angle.
** {{PropertyView|Color Out Of Draft1+2}}: Marks areas with draft angles below the required angle that can be interpreted as having no draft at all.
