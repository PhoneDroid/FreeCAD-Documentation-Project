== Introducción ==

A [[PartDesign Feature|PartDesign Feature]] refers to a "step" in the modelling process that happens inside of a [[PartDesign Body|PartDesign Body]]. For example, each time you add a solid box with [[PartDesign AdditiveBox|PartDesign AdditiveBox]], you add a feature; when you add a chamfer to an edge with [[PartDesign Chamfer|PartDesign Chamfer]], you add another feature; when you cut a hole using a [[Sketch|sketch]] and [[PartDesign Pocket|PartDesign Pocket]], you add another feature.

There are many types of features which can add or remove volume from an initial solid. The word "feature" refers to the operation itself, and also to the resulting solid after that operation.

To learn more about creating solid objects with the [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] see [[feature editing|feature editing]].

== Utilización ==

Almost all tools in the [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] are meant to add features to a [[PartDesign Body|PartDesign Body]]. These tools can be accessed from the menu and toolbar buttons while an object or sub-element (vertex, edge, face) is selected.

The features can be placed in different categories:
* Feature base: refers to the Base Feature object that can be created in a [[PartDesign Body|PartDesign Body]].
* Additive and subtractive
** Primitive shapes: [[PartDesign_AdditiveBox|Box]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveCone|Cone]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveCylinder|Cylinder]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveEllipsoid|Ellipsoid]], [[PartDesign_AdditivePrism|Prism]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveSphere|Sphere]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveTorus|Torus]], and [[PartDesign_AdditiveWedge|Wedge]].
** Primitive shapes subtractive: [[PartDesign_SubtractiveBox|Subtractive Box]], [[PartDesign_SubtractiveCone|Subtractive Cone]], [[PartDesign_SubtractiveCylinder|Subtractive Cylinder]], [[PartDesign_SubtractiveEllipsoid|Subtractive Ellipsoid]], [[PartDesign_SubtractivePrism|Subtractive Prism]], [[PartDesign_SubtractiveSphere|Subtractive Sphere]], [[PartDesign_SubtractiveTorus|Subtractive Torus]], and [[PartDesign_SubtractiveWedge|Subtractive Wedge]].
** Profile based: [[PartDesign_Pad|Pad]], [[PartDesign_Revolution|Revolution]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveLoft|Loft]], [[PartDesign_AdditivePipe|Pipe]].
** Profile based subtractive: [[PartDesign_Pocket|Pocket]], [[PartDesign_Hole|Hole]], [[PartDesign_Groove|Groove]], [[PartDesign_SubtractiveLoft|Subtractive Loft]], [[PartDesign_SubtractivePipe|Subtractive Pipe]].
* [[PartDesign_Boolean|Boolean]], including fuse, cut, and common.
* Dress up
** [[PartDesign_Chamfer|Chamfer]]
** [[PartDesign_Draft|Draft]]
** [[PartDesign_Fillet|Fillet]]
** [[PartDesign_Thickness|Thickness]]
* Transform
** [[PartDesign_LinearPattern|Linear pattern]]
** [[PartDesign_Mirrored|Mirrored]]
** [[PartDesign_MultiTransform|Multi-transformed]]
** [[PartDesign_PolarPattern|Polar pattern]]
** [[PartDesign_Scaled|Scaled]]

See [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] for the general information on adding objects from the [[Python console|Python console]].

See [[PartDesign Body|PartDesign Body]] for the general information on adding a Body. Once a Body exists, features can be attached to it using the Body's {{incode|addObject()}} method.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject('PartDesign::Body', 'Body')
obj.Label = "Custom label"

feature = App.ActiveDocument.addObject('PartDesign::AdditiveBox', 'Box')
feature.Width = 200
feature.Length = 300
feature.Height = 500
obj.addObject(feature)
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()

feature2 = App.ActiveDocument.addObject('PartDesign::SubtractiveBox', 'Box')
feature2.Width = 50
feature2.Length = 200
feature2.Height = 400
obj.addObject(feature2)
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()
}}
