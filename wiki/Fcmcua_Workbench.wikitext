== Introduction ==

Fcmcua is an [[External_workbenches|external workbench]] that is used to control an assembly created in [[Assembly4_Workbench|Assembly4 Workbench]] from an [[wikipedia:OPC Unified Architecture|OPC UA]] server. This provides functionality for simulating machines controlled by digital controllers such as [[wikipedia:Programmable logic controller|PLCs]], so long as the controller supports OPC UA. The workbench uses the values provided by the OPC UA server to manipulate the Attachment Offset of each part's Local Coordinate System (LCS).

== Installation ==

Fcmcua can be installed from the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]].

== Usage ==

Fcmcua provides two types of mechanisms for simulating movement in a model: '''Axis''' and '''Actuator'''.

An '''axis''' is controlled by [[wikipedia:Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] values that represent either the axis position or the speed of the motor that drives the axis.

An '''actuator''' is any motion triggered by a binary signal. In that case Fcmcua itself simulates the motion by calculating the positional values needed for the simulation.

For further usage instructions see the [https://github.com/heissgetraenk/fcmcua Fcmcua repository].

=== Connection ===

[[File:Fcmcua_wb.svg|64px]]

A URL to the OPC UA server must be specified in the form of {{Incode|opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:4840}}.

Setting a polling rate may be used to limit the time between updates to the FreeCAD assembly.

The connection state is displayed on the connection panel.

=== Axis Settings ===

An axis node on the OPC UA server represents a one-dimensional change in the Attachment Offset of a part in the assembly. To configure this assignment the following information must be specified:

* '''Node Id: ''' The address of the server node.
* '''Document Name:''' The name of the part's document.
* '''LCS:''' The label of the part's Local Coordinate System.
* '''Offset:''' The vector component of the Attachment Offset that the node value will update.
* '''Type:''' Speed axis or positional axis.

The value from the server can also be inverted or scaled by supplying a mathematical sign and/or factor.

=== Actuator Settings ===

An actuator node on the OPC UA server acts as a trigger to ''open'' or ''close'' the actuator. To configure the actuator the following information must be specified:

* '''Type:''' Describes how many signals are used to open or close the actuator.
* '''Conditional Block:''' An actuator may have a stop in its travel, activated by another binary signal. This feature is optional.
* '''Node Ids:''' Depending on the configuration: the addresses of the nodes that trigger the opening/closing or the block of the actuator.
* '''Positions:''' Depending on the configuration: the Attachment Offset values in the model that represent the open, close or block position of the actuator.
* '''Durations:''' The timing with which the actuator opens or closes.
