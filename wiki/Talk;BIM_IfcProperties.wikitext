In the page it states:
<blockquote>
Defining your own property sets
The available property sets that are predefined in the IFC standard are stored in a [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Arch/Presets/pset_definitions.csv csv file bundled with FreeCAD]
</blockquote>
but it isn't there

FreeCAD.getResourceDir() In my anaconda env it is here:
...\fc1.0\Library\data\Mod\BIM\Presets\pset_definitions.csv 
should I modify the page?

The path has changed, as Arch is now BIM, I'll fix the link
