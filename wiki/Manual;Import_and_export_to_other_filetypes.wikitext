FreeCAD can import and export to many file types. Here is a list of the most important ones with a short description of the available features:

<!--T:3-->

! Notes 
|-
| STEP   
| Yes    
| Yes    
| This is the most faithful import/export format available since it supports solid geometry and NURBS. Use it whenever it is possible. 
|-
| IGES   
| Yes    
| Yes    
| An older solid format, also very well supported. Some older applications don't support STEP but have IGES. 
|-
| BREP   
| Yes    
| Yes    
| The native format of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Cascade_Technology OpenCasCade], FreeCAD's geometry kernel.  
|-
| DXF    
| Yes    
| Yes    
| An open format maintained by Autodesk. Since the 3D data inside a DXF file is encoded in a proprietary format, FreeCAD can only import/export 2D data to/from this format.
|-
| DWG    
| Yes    
| Yes    
| The proprietary version of DXF. Requires the installation of the [https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles Teigha File Converter] utility. This format suffers from the same limitations as DXF.
|-
| OBJ    
| Yes    
| Yes    
| A mesh-based format. Can only contain triangulated meshes. All solid and NURBS-based objects of FreeCAD will be converted to mesh on export. An alternative exporter is provided by the Arch workbench, more suited to the export of architectural models.
|-
| DAE    
| Yes    
| Yes    
| The main import/export format of Sketchup. Can only contain triangulated meshes. All solid and NURBS-based objects of FreeCAD will be converted to mesh on export. 
|-
| STL    
| Yes    
| Yes    
| A mesh-based format, commonly used for 3D printing. Can only contain triangulated meshes. All solid and NURBS-based objects of FreeCAD will be converted to mesh on export. 
|-
| PLY    
| Yes    
| Yes    
| An older mesh-based format. Can only contain triangulated meshes. All solid and NURBS-based objects of FreeCAD will be converted to mesh on export. 
|-
| IFC    
| Yes    
| Yes    
| [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes Industry Foundation Classes]. Requires the installation of [http://ifcopenshell.org/python IfcOpenShell-python]. The IFC format and its compatibility with other applications is a complex affair, use with care.
|-
| SVG    
| Yes    
| Yes    
| An excellent, widespread 2D graphics format 
|-
| VRML   
| Yes    
| Yes    
| A rather old mesh-based web format. 
|-
| GCODE  
| Yes    
| Yes    
| FreeCAD can already import and export to/from several flavors of GCode, but only a small number of machines are supported at the moment. 
|-
| CSG    
| Yes    
| No     
| OpenSCAD's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry CSG] (Constructive Solid Geometry) format.
