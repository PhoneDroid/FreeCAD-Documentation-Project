==Introduction== 

The [[Image:Cables_workbench_icon.svg|24px]] [[Cables_Workbench|Cables Workbench]] is a toolset for modeling electrical installations in architectural design projects. It is made to help run cables inside buildings or other objects and to build models of cables with the possibility of making single wire connections. It is an [[External workbenches|external workbench]].

This toolset can be used to create electrical boxes or other ready to use electrical elements (the element list will hopefully be expanded in the future). These elements can be connected with fully parametric cables of different profiles, number of wires and thicknesses. There are a few predefined cable profiles here, but there is also possibility to create own non standard profiles with a simple csv file.

Models built with this workbench allow easy repositioning of elements without breaking connections. Cables can adjust their shape to new positions. However, this feature is not perfect yet.

The workbench aims to be compatible with [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]] but it can be used for purposes other than architectural designs. It is planned in the future to make the workbench also more suitable for modeling pcb connections (any help in creating, for example, a set of ready-made connectors is very welcome).

==Installation==

It is planned to add this workbench to the [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. So far see [[Installing_more_workbenches|Installing more workbenches]] for manual installation.

==Tools==

Cable tools are divided into few groups depending on their purpose.

===Wire manipulation tools===

* [[Image:Cables_WireFlex.svg|32px]] [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]]: Creates a new WireFlex object stretched between two or more selected vertexes|objects

* [[Image:Cables_AddVertex.svg|32px]] [[Cables_AddVertex|Add Vertex to WireFlex]]: Creates additional vertex on a selected WireFlex edge.

* [[Image:Cables_DelVertex.svg|32px]] [[Cables_DelVertex|Delete Vertex from WireFlex]]: Deletes selected WireFlex vertex.

* [[Image:Cables_AttachVertex.svg|32px]] [[Cables_AttachVertex|Attach WireFlex Vertex]]: Attaches selected WireFlex vertex to external vertex|object.

* [[Image:Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment.svg|32px]] [[Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment|Remove WireFlex Vertex Attachment]]: Removes selected WireFlex vertex attachment from external vertex|object.

===Tools for making cables and other ready-made elements===

* [[Image:Cables_Profile.svg|32px]] [[Cables_Profile|Cable Profile]]: Adds a new cable profile to the current document.

* [[Image:Cables_Cable.svg|32px]] [[Cables_Cable|Cable]]: Adds a new cable based on selected wire and profile.

* [[Image:Cables_CableBox.svg|32px]] [[Cables_CableBox|Cable Box]]: Adds a new parametric cable box.

* [[Image:Cables_CableConnector.svg|32px]] [[Cables_CableConnector|Cable Connector]]: Adds a new parametric universal cable connector.

* [[Image:Cables_CableLightPoint.svg|32px]] [[Cables_CableLightPoint|Cable Light Point]]: Adds a new parametric universal light point for cable.

* [[Image:Cables_Material.svg|32px]] [[Cables_Material|Cable Materials]]: Adds a default set of multimaterials to the current document.

===Support tools===

* [[Image:Cables_SupportPoint.svg|32px]] [[Cables_SupportPoint|Support Point]]: Adds a universal support point.

* [[Image:Cables_SupportLine.svg|32px]] [[Cables_SupportLine|Support Line]]: Adds a universal support line.

=== External tools ===

* [[Image:Draft_ToggleGrid.svg|32px]] [[Draft_ToggleGrid|Toggle grid]]: Changes the visibility of the grid.


==Basic Workflow Description==

# Create endpoints for cables like: [[Cables_CableBox|Cable Box]] or [[Cables_CableLightPoint|Cable Light Point]] and arrange them in a 3D space.
# Create base wires connecting created endpoints with [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] and arrange them in a 3D space with the help of [[Cables_SupportLine|Support Lines]] or [[Cables_SupportPoint|Support Points]].
# Create [[Cables_Profile|Cable Profiles]] suitable for the project.
# Create [[Cables_Cable|Cables]] based on existing base wires and profiles.
# Color the cables with the predefined or customized [[Cables_Material|Cable Materials]].
# Finally (and optionally) connect chosen single cable wires using [[Cables_CableConnector|Cable Connectors]].
