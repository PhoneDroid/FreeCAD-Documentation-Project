====Thumbnails and live preview====

To see the impact of the selected texture options you can check the pre-rendered thumbnail or use the live preview to render the texture.

===Lighting===

With the three light types: area light, point light and spot light, and their different options, you can create advanced lighting.

==Installation==

This workbench can be installed and updated from the [[Image:AddonManager.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. The [http://www.povray.org/ POV-Ray] renderer used by the workbench has to be installed separately. For Windows users, the installer can be downloaded from the [https://www.povray.org/download/ POV-Ray Download Page], for Linux users it can usually be installed from the package manager. Look up the detailed instructions in the [https://wiki.povray.org/content/HowTo:Install_POV POV-Ray Wiki] if you're on a Mac.

To complete the installation the path to the POV-Ray executable has to be defined in the workbench preferences, usually these are the default paths:
* '''Windows:''' {{FileName|C:/Program Files/POV-Ray/v3.7/bin/pvengine64.exe}} (the {{FileName|v*.*}} folder may change depending on the POV-Ray version)
* '''Linux:''' {{FileName|/usr/bin/povray}}
* '''MacOS:''' Not available. If you have more information, please let us know.
