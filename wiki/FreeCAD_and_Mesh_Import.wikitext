== Post-Import ==

After import the model is (for FreeCAD), just an assembly of faces. You might want to convert the model into a shape FreeCAD can recognize and that could be altered in FreeCAD.

To do this:
# Switch to the [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|24px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]]
# Select the mesh, and go to the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Part_ShapeFromMesh|Create shape from mesh]]}} or press the [[Image:Part_ShapeFromMesh.svg|24px]] [[Part_ShapeFromMesh|Part ShapeFromMesh]] button
# Click {{Button|OK}} in the dialog
# Select the newly created shape
# Go to {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Part_MakeSolid|Convert to solid]]}}
# Select the newly created solid
# Go to {{MenuCommand|Part → Create a copy → [[Part RefineShape|Refine shape]]}} or press the [[Image:Part_RefineShape.svg|24px]] [[Part_RefineShape|Part RefineShape]] button

'''Note:''' The last step is not necessary, but it will clean the solid of most of its residual edges on planar and cylindrical surfaces.

== Errors ==

=== "cannot convert because shape is not a shell" ===

Well, your shell seems to have errors, maybe it is not closed (has holes). Since the capabilities of the Mesh workbench in FreeCAD are a little limited at the moment, you might want to try examining and repairing your model with third-party software. After doing that, you may try importing and converting your model again.
