| [[File:Navi_Cube_relnotes_0.21.png]]
| The [[Navigation_Cube|Navigation Cube]] has been updated. The cube is no longer shown in perspective if the [[3D_view|3D view]] is in orthographic view mode. Corner faces have been made hexagonal and larger so that they are easier to click. Borders have been added around the buttons. Default font selection and sizing has been improved. The Mini-cube menu now includes a checkbox to toggle the movability of the cube. Several new parameters have been added, see the [[Navigation_Cube|Navigation Cube]] page for more information.</br>[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7876 Pull request #7876], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8266 Pull request #8266], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8646 Pull request #8646] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9356 Pull request #9356].

=== Further user interface improvements === <!--T:9-->

<!--T:57-->
* The buttons for [[Image:Std_Print.svg|24px]] [[Std_Print|Print]] and [[Image:Std_UserEditModeDefault.svg|24px]] [[Std_UserEditMode|Edit Mode]] have been removed from the File toolbar. They can be re-added by [[Std_DlgCustomize|customizing]] your toolbar. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7570 Pull request #7570] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/ea9a04e commit ea9a04e]
* The File toolbar has been split. The buttons for [[Image:Std_Undo.svg|24px]] [[Std_Undo|Undo]], [[Image:Std_Redo.svg|24px]] [[Std_Redo|Redo]] and [[Image:Std_Refresh.svg|24px]] [[Std_Refresh|Refresh]] have been moved to the new Edit toolbar. The buttons for [[Image:Std_Cut.svg|24px]] [[Std_Cut|Cut]], [[Image:Std_Copy.svg|24px]]  [[Std_Copy|Copy]] and [[Image:Std_Paste.svg|24px]] [[Std_Paste|Paste]] have been moved to the new Clipboard toolbar. The button for [[Image:Std_WhatsThis.svg|24px]] [[Std_WhatsThis|What's This?]] has been moved to the new Help toolbar. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7620 Pull request #7620]
* Commands to [[Std_StoreWorkingView|store]] and [[Std_RecallWorkingView|recall]] a temporary working view have been added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7525 Pull request #7525]
* Value changes with the mouse wheel in 'input fields' (a widget type used to enter values in task panels, for example by [[Draft_Line|Draft Line]]) are disabled if the widget doesn't have the focus and the [[Fine-tuning#Mouse_related|ComboBoxWheelEventFilter]] parameter is enabled. This prevents unwanted value changes while scrolling, as was already the case for spin and combo boxes. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7561 Pull request #7561]
* It is now possible to set a default transparency for new [[Part_Workbench|Part]] or [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign]] objects in the [[PartDesign_Preferences|Preferences]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7103 Pull request #7103]
* There is the new orbit style '''Free Turntable'''. It can either be enabled in the [[Preferences_Editor#Navigation|Preferences]] or by pressing the {{Button|[[File:NavigationCAD_dark.svg|16px]]}} button in the [[Status_bar|Status bar]] and then using the menu {{MenuCommand|Settings â†’ Orbit}}). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8048 Pull Request #8048]
* The [[Std_SetAppearance|Std SetAppearance]] task panel now also has a button to set the Point Color property. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7708 Pull request #7708]
* A button has been added to switch the colors of the [[3D_view|3D view]] background gradient in the [[Preferences_Editor#Colors|Preferences]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7155 Pull request #7155]
* All transparency settings use now the uniform spin button step of 5%: One click on the button in a dialog or the [[Property_editor|property editor]] changes the transparency by 5%. Keep the button pressed to change several 5% steps at once. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7723 Pull request #7723]
* The Output window has been renamed to Report view for uniformity with the UI. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7739 Pull Request #7739]
* The Image Workbench has been removed. To insert an Image Plane the [[Std_Import|Std Import]] command can now be used. Double-click an Image Plane to change its orientation and scale. The new [[Std_ViewLoadImage|Std ViewLoadImage]] command replaces the Image Open command. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8955 Pull Request #8955]
* The deprecated Raytracing Workbench has been removed. The external [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render Render Workbench] should be used instead. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9420 Pull Request #9420]

== Core system and API == <!--T:10-->

=== Core === <!--T:11-->

<!--T:89-->

== Addon Manager == <!--T:16-->

<!--T:108-->
* Added basic Python package management for updating and removing automatically-installed dependencies.
* Added a "developer mode" to aid in the creation of the metadata file required in each Addon.

== Arch Workbench == <!--T:17-->

<!--T:84-->
* Several [[Arch_Profile|Arch Profile]] categories have been added: IS RHS, IS SHS, IS Angle and IS Tee. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7181 Pull request #7181] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7217 Pull request #7217]
* [[Arch_Profile|Arch Profile]] objects now support modification of the profile type after creation. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7217 Pull request #7217]
* Several edit mode issues have been fixed and the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] context menus for Arch objects have been improved. Objects that can be edited now have an {{MenuCommand|Edit}} option in that menu. The {{MenuCommand|Set colors}} option was removed for objects without a face or that can only have a single face. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8122 Pull request #8122]
* [[Arch_SectionPlane|Arch SectionPlane]] objects now handle non-solid objects the same as solid objects. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8688 Pull request #8688]

=== Further Arch improvements === <!--T:61-->

<!--T:62-->
* The {{MenuCommand|Invert hinge position}} tool has been improved. For all rectangular wires the opposite edge is now correctly detected. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8199 Pull request #8199]
* The Terrain of an [[Arch_Site|Arch Site]] can now also be a solid. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8409 Pull request #8409]
* An [[Arch_Site|Arch Site]] no longer shows a phantom representation of the objects in its Group. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8409 Pull request #8409]

== Draft Workbench == <!--T:18-->

<!--T:63-->
* The inaccuracy of [[Draft_Snap_Near|Draft Snap Near]] when snapping to curves was fixed. In addition, [[Draft_Snap_Perpendicular|Draft Snap Perpendicular]] can now also snap to faces and find multiple points. To snap to a vertex (e.g. a [[Draft_Point|Draft Point]]) [[Draft_Snap_Endpoint|Draft Snap Endpoint]] must now be used instead of [[Draft_Snap_Near|Draft Snap Near]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7132 Pull request #7132]
* To make working with [[Draft_Layer|layers]] easier their drag and drop behavior was modified. If you drop an object from a [[Std_Group|Std Group]], or a group-like object such as an [[Arch_BuildingPart|Arch BuildingPart]], on a layer, it is no longer removed from the group, and vice versa. This works without holding down the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7462 Pull request #7462]
* The [[Draft_PointArray|Draft PointArray]] command now supports more point object types. Any object with a shape and vertices, as well as a [[Mesh_Workbench|mesh]] and a [[Points_Workbench|point cloud]] can be used. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7597 Pull request #7597]
* The [[Tree_view|Tree view]] context menus for Draft objects have been improved. Objects that can be edited with the [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]] command, or that have a dedicated edit solution, now have an {{MenuCommand|Edit}} option in that menu. The {{MenuCommand|Set colors}} option was removed for objects without a face or that can only have a single face. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7970 Pull request #7970]
* The properties of Draft annotation objects have been unified. [[Draft_Text|Draft Text]], [[Draft_Dimension|Draft Dimension]] and [[Draft_Label|Draft Label]] objects now all have a Font Name, a Font Size and a Text Color property. The Display Mode options have been made consistent as well and are now: Screen and World. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/7861 Issue #7861] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8081 Pull request #8081]
* In the task panel of the [[Draft_SetStyle|Draft SetStyle]] command the {{MenuCommand|Texts/dims}} button has been replaced by the {{MenuCommand|Annotations}} button. Pressing this button will process all annotations, including [[Draft_Label|Draft Labels]]. {{MenuCommand|Dim overshoot}}, {{MenuCommand|Ext lines}} and {{MenuCommand|Ext overshoot}} parameters have been added. Several minor additional issues were also fixed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8190 Pull request #8190],  [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8195 Pull request #8195], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8196 Pull request #8196] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9514 Pull request #9514].
* Undo/Redo did not work properly for the Draft modification commands on Windows. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8267 Pull request #8267]
* The [[Draft_LayerManager|LayerManager command]] has been migrated from the BIM Workbench to the Draft Workbench. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8795 Pull request #8795]

=== Further Draft improvements === <!--T:19-->

<!--T:73-->
* When aligning the working plane with a face it was only rotated to match the global axes if the face was a quad. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7249 Pull request #7249]
* Several [[Draft_PathArray|Draft PathArray]] related issues have been fixed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7506 Pull request #7506] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7662 Pull request #7662]
* The [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]] command has received several improvements. For [[Draft_Wire|wires]], [[Draft_BSpline|B-splines]] and [[Draft BezCurve|BÃ©zier curves]] a Close/Open option has been added to the edge context menu. For B-splines and BÃ©zier curves a Reverse option has been added to the same menu as well. The task panels have been cleaned up. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7527 Pull request #7527] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7541 Pull request #7541]
* Using Esc to exit a command no longer switches off continue mode. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7611 Pull request #7611]
* The [[Draft_Snap|Draft Snap]] toolbar was changed to a standard toolbar. Keyboard shortcuts can now be assigned to snaps. But using them during a command only works if none of the input boxes in the task panel has the focus as they 'catch' the so-called in-command shortcuts. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7656 Pull request #7656]
* Several [[Draft_AnnotationStyleEditor|Draft AnnotationStyleEditor]] bugs have been fixed. The {{MenuCommand|Text color}} and {{MenuCommand|Text spacing}} parameters have been added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8207 Pull request #8207] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9702 Pull request #9702]
* Start and End Offset properties have been added to [[Draft_PathArray|Draft PathArray]] objects. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8295 Pull request #8295]
* A Count property has been added to the arrays that lacked this property: the non-Link versions of [[Draft_OrthoArray|Draft OrthoArray]], [[Draft_PolarArray|Draft PolarArray]] and [[Draft_CircularArray|Draft CircularArray]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8433 Pull request #8433]
* The on/off behavior of the [[Draft_Snap_Grid|grid]] has been fixed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8818 Pull request #8818]
* The handling of DWG converters has been improved. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9444 Pull request #9444] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9830 Pull request #9830]

=== Further FEM improvements === <!--T:21-->

<!--T:65-->
* When performing analyses using the [[Image:FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools.svg|24px]] [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX solver]], there is now also a [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|results pipeline]] created to visualize the results. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8525 Pull request #8525] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8903 Pull request #8903]
* It is now possible to perform [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings#Timestepping_(transient_analyses)|transient analyses]] when using the [[Image:FEM_SolverElmer.svg|32px]] [[FEM_SolverElmer|Elmer solver]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9056 Pull request #9056]
* The [[Image:FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure|initial pressure constraint]] was added to set the initial internal pressure of fluids. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7364 Pull request #7364]
* The [[Image:FEM_ConstraintCurrentDensity.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintCurrentDensity|current density constraint]] was added to set current densities for bodies and faces. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8348 Pull request #8348]
* The [[Image:FEM_ConstraintMagnetization.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintMagnetization|magnetization constraint]] was added to set magnetizations for bodies and faces. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8393 Pull request #8393]
* The [[Image:FEM_ConstraintFlowVelocity.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintFlowVelocity|flow velocity constraint]] and [[Image:FEM_ConstraintInitialFlowVelocity.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintInitialFlowVelocity|initial flow velocity constraint]] were completely rewritten. It is now also possible to specify a velocity via a math formula (to define a velocity profile). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8963 Pull request #8963] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8964 Pull request #8964]</br>'''Note:''' This is a breaking change. Analyses with existing flow velocity and initial flow velocity constraints will not work anymore. You have to create new flow velocity constraints in the analysis to make existing analyses work.</br>'''Also note:''' until FreeCAD 0.21 the results of the flow solver were wrong (fluid density and viscosity were a factor 1000 too high). Therefore the necessary recreation of the velocity constraint also assures the results will be correct.
* It is now possible to define in the [[Image:FEM_ConstraintDisplacement.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintDisplacement|displacement constraint]] displacements as equations (displacement according to the current solver time).
* The [[Image:FEM_ConstraintBodyHeatSource.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintBodyHeatSource|body heat source constraint]] has now a task panel and it is possible to set the heat for several bodies or to use several constraints for different bodies in one analysis. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7367 Pull request #7367]
* The [[Image:FEM_ConstraintSpring.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintSpring|spring constraint]] was not used by any solver. Now it can be used by the [[FEM_SolverElmer|Elmer]] solver via the equations [[FEM_EquationDeformation|Deformation]] and [[FEM_EquationElasticity|Elasticity]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9005 Pull request #9005]
* The result mesh cut function [[Image:FEM_PostCreateFunctionCylinder.svg|24px]] [[FEM_PostCreateFunctionCylinder|Filter function cylinder]] was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8735 Pull request #8735]
* The result mesh cut function [[Image:FEM_PostCreateFunctionBox.svg|24px]] [[FEM_PostCreateFunctionBox|Filter function box]] was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8825 Pull request #8825]
* It is now possible to open (and this way visualize) *.pvtu files (partitioned VTK unstructured grid data). A *.pvtu file is also the result of an [[FEM_SolverElmer|Elmer]] simulation, when more than one CPU core is used for calculations. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7159 Pull request #7159]
* Critical Strain Ratio has been added to the VTK result pipeline. It gives an indication of ductile rupture for materials with a "MaterialMechanicalNonlinear" object. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7467 Pull request #7467]
* [[Image:FEM_FemMesh2Mesh.svg|24px]] [[FEM_FemMesh2Mesh|FEM mesh to mesh]] has the new parameter ''scale'' to define the scale of deformed mesh using Python. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=71936 Forum thread] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7715 Pull request #7715]
* The [[FEM_Preferences|preferences]] have a new option to define which solver should automatically be added when creating a new analysis.
* Usability improvements:
** If you are in the FEM workbench when loading a FreeCAD file containing an analysis, the analysis gets activated automatically (you have immediate access to all FEM toolbar buttons).
** The toolbar only has buttons for solvers installed on your system. Unavailable solvers are no longer displayed.
* New example files for the following equations are available via the [[FEM_Examples|FEM Examples]]: [[FEM_EquationDeformation|Deformation]], [[FEM_EquationFlow|Flow]], [[FEM_EquationFlux|Flux]], [[FEM_EquationHeat|Heat]], [[FEM_EquationMagnetodynamic|Magnetodynamic]] and [[FEM_EquationMagnetodynamic2D|Magnetodynamic 2D]].

=== Further PartDesign improvements === <!--T:29-->

<!--T:77-->
* In the [[PartDesign_Hole|Hole]] dialog, the deprecated screw head types (cheese head, cap screw etc.) have been removed. They were deprecated since FreeCAD 0.19. Holes using these types are transformed to custom countersinks/counterbore holes with the diameter and depth used by the types. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7654 Pull request #7654]
* In the [[PartDesign_AdditiveLoft|Additive Loft]] and [[PartDesign_SubtractiveLoft|Subtractive Loft]] dialogs, the previously non-functional option '''Closed''' does now create a closed loft (like a ring). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8748 Pull request #8748]
* The [[Sketcher_ValidateSketch|Validate sketch]] command was added to Helper toolbar. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7700 Pull request #7700]
* The unusable [[Sketcher_LeaveSketch|Leave sketch]] and [[Sketcher_ViewSketch|View sketch]] commands were removed from the menu. The [[Sketcher_EditSketch|Edit sketch]], [[Sketcher_MergeSketches|Merge sketches]] and [[Sketcher_MirrorSketch|Mirror sketch]] commands were added to the menu. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7700 Pull request #7700]
* The [[PartDesign_InvoluteGear|involute gear profile]] has new properties to change the tooth length. This now allows adjustments for certain types of interferences and to use the profile to create [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mechanical) involute splines] too. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8184 Pull request #8184]
* The [[PartDesign_InvoluteGear|involute gear profile]] now offers profile shifting. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5618 Issue #5618] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8934 Pull request #8934]
* When creating a [[PartDesign_Clone|Clone]] it will now inherit the colors of the cloned object. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9547 Pull request #9547]

== Path Workbench == <!--T:30-->

<!--T:31-->
* Camotics integration. If camotics (version 1.2.2 or later) is installed, a new icon will be added to the Path toolbar. Select a Path Job and press the button to open the Camotics dialog. Then drag the slider to generate a simulated solid at any point in the job. You can also launch the full camotics application to run the animated simulaton. This results in a silent post-processing of the job and creation of a camotics project file. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6637 Pull request #6637]

<!--T:32-->
* Additional substitution strings for automatic output naming. If output is being split into multiple files, the filenames can automatically substitute the toolcontroller label, Work Coordinate Systems (WCS), or operation label. This is in addition to the other existing substitution strings like date, job name, etc.

<!--T:66-->
* Implemented Chipbreaking option for peck style drill cycles. Chipbreaking emits a G73 cycle which causes the control to make a very small retraction move to break the chip without fully retracting the bit from the hole. G73 is supported natively by LinuxCNC. Some other postprocessors will have to interpret the G73 and emit control appropriate codes or decompose the retraction into G1/G0 moves. Postprocessor support for G73 decomposition has been added to the "refactored" postprocessors.[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7469 Pull request #7469]

== Compilation == <!--T:47-->

<!--T:48-->
Since this release FreeCAD can only be compiled using Qt 5.x and Python 3.x. The lowest supported Qt version is 5.12, the lowest supported Python version is 3.8.

<!--T:49-->
To compile FreeCAD see the instructions for [[Compile_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Compile_on_Linux|Linux]] and [[Compile_on_MacOS|macOS]].

<!--T:50-->
The supported operating systems are:
* Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11
* Linux Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04) and newer
* macOS: 10.12 Sierra or newer

== Known Limitations == <!--T:51-->

===32bit Windows=== <!--T:52-->

<!--T:53-->
Since FreeCAD 0.19 we no longer officially support 32bit Windows. FreeCAD might work on these systems, but no support is given.

===Remote Desktop under Windows=== <!--T:54-->

<!--T:55-->
Depending on the OpenGL graphics capabilities of a computer, it might be that one encounters a crash when running FreeCAD via remote desktop. To fix this upgrade your OpenGL driver.
Only if this doesn't help:
* Download [https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=mesa64-latest this] OpenGL library for 64bit Windows and extract it.
* Rename the DLL file to ''opengl32sw.dll'' and copy it to the ''bin'' subfolder of FreeCAD's installation folder (overwrite the existing DLL there).

===macOS: Start Workbench shows blank page === <!--T:70-->

<!--T:71-->
If the [[Start_Workbench|Start Workbench]] shows only a blank page, you must enable the option '''Use software OpenGL''' in the menu {{MenuCommand|FreeCAD-0.21 â†’ Preferences â†’ Display}}.

==Other Resources== <!--T:106-->
