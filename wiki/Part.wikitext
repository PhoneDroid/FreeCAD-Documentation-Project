In FreeCAD the word "[[Part|Part]]" is normally used to refer to a [[File:Std_Part.svg|24px]] [[Std_Part|Std Part]] ({{incode|App::Part}} class), a type of container object that is defined by the base system. This Part is used to manage the position of 3D shapes in order to create mechanical assemblies.

<!--T:3-->
See [[File:Std_Part.svg|24px]] [[Std_Part|Std Part]] for more information about this type of object.

== Usage == <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
The Std Part tool is not defined by a particular workbench, but by the base system, thus it is found in the {{MenuCommand|structure toolbar}}, which is available in all [[Workbenches|workbenches]].

<!--T:6-->
# Press the {{Button|[[File:Std_Part.svg|16px]] [[Std_Part|Std Part]]}} button. An empty Part is created and automatically becomes ''[[Std_Part#Active_status|active]]''.

== Notes == <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
In informal usage, a "Part" may be any geometrical figure that is visible in the [[3D view|3D view]], and thus its concept may be confused with that of "[[Body|Body]]" or "[[Assembly|Assembly]]".

<!--T:9-->
However, when more precision is required, the distinction must be made.
* A "[[Body|Body]]" is used for single contiguous elements, usually created with the [[Part_Workbench|Part]] or [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbenches]].
* A "Part" is used to group a single "Body", or several of them to form an "Assembly".
* An "Assembly" is a collection of "Parts" arranged in some way, manually, or by using an assembly workbench.
