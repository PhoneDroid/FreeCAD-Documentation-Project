== General == <!--T:8-->

=== freecad.org === <!--T:135-->

<!--T:136-->
We are happy that the [https://www.kicad.org/ KiCAD project], through the [https://www.kipro-pcb.com/ KiCAD services corp.], sponsored us the domain freecad.org. Now all FreeCAD websites are available under [https://freecadweb.org freecadweb.org] and [https://freecad.org freecad.org].

=== Bug/Issue tracker === <!--T:132-->

<!--T:133-->
The FreeCAD bug tracker was moved to GitHub: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues

<!--T:134-->
'''Note:''' Only bug reports with a prior forum discussion will be considered. Reports without this will be closed.

=== New help system === <!--T:174-->

<!--T:175-->
The help system was rewritten and upgraded to display information directly from our [[User_hub|Wiki]]. The system now relies on the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Help Help Addon]. When you first use the [[Std_Help|Help]] tool or the [[Std_WhatsThis|What's this?]] tool you will be asked to install it.

== User interface == <!--T:16-->

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:Navi_Cube_relnotes_0.20.gif]]
| The navigation cube was reworked:
* There are now edge faces to rotate the 3D view 45°.
* A new preference [[Preferences_Editor#Navigation|Rotate to nearest]] has been introduced. If selected, the 3D view is rotated to the nearest most logical position, based on the current orientation of the cube, when a cube face is clicked. Else clicking a face will always result in the same rotation. To experience the difference try the same click sequence as in the animation with and without the option ''Rotate to nearest''.
* By clicking the new round button in the top right corner you can quickly switch to the backview of the current scene.
* The size of the cube can now be adjusted with the [[Preferences_Editor#Navigation|Cube size]] preference.

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:Improved tooltips_relnotes_0.20.gif]]
| Tooltips now display the command name in the title, making it easier for new users to look for help. At the end of the tooltip the "internal" command name is added in parentheses: ''(Std_WhatsThis)''. This is also the name of the page that documents the command in the Wiki.

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:Std_UserEditMode_relnotes_0.20.gif|384px]]
| The new [[Std_UserEditMode|Std UserEditMode]] command allows the user to choose an edit mode that will be used when an object is double-clicked in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]. Click the image on the left so see an animation of the selection. If a selected edit mode is not applicable, the object's default edit mode is used instead.

=== Further user interface improvements === <!--T:18-->

<!--T:19-->
* It is now possible to use the decimal separator belonging to the language specified for the FreeCAD interface. For example on a German Windows, when you set the interface language to '''English''' and select the new option '''Use selected language number format''', the dot will be used as the decimal separator. See [[Preferences_Editor#General|Preferences]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6364 Pull request #6364]</br>'''Note''': For [[FEM_Workbench|FEM]] simulations using the dot as decimal separator is highly recommended to get correct results.
* Two new mouse navigation styles have been added. One based on [[Mouse_navigation#OpenSCAD_navigation|OpenSCAD]], the other on [[Mouse_navigation#TinkerCAD_navigation|TinkerCAD]]. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=60975 Forum discussion OpenSCAD], [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=544639#p544376 Forum discussion TinkerCAD], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/a1c9ab658c commit 1], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/ef100d55e9d50 commit 2], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/549e5b5650 commit 3].
* It is now possible to pan the view of the [[Std_DependencyGraph|dependency graph]] with the mouse. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=34791 Forum discussion], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4638 Pull request #4638].
* Fixed an issue where using tablet pen devices (e.g. Wacom tablet) was slow to the point of being completely unusable. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=45046 Forum discussion], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4687 Pull request #4687].
* The coordinate system in the 3D view can be resized in the preferences in the section [[Preferences_Editor#3D_View|Display → 3D View]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5182 Pull request #5182]
* A new setting in [[Preferences_Editor#General|Preferences → General]] allows to substitute the numerical keypad decimal separator with the appropriate locale separator if they are different. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3256 Pull request #3256] [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5150 Pull request #5150] [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5203 Pull request 5203]
* It is now possible to set the {{KEY|Backspace}} key as a standalone shortcut key without the need to specify an additional modifier key. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5428 Pull request #5428]

<!--T:76-->
{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:Object_selection_relnotes_0.20.png|384px]]
| When using {{MenuCommand|Edit → Copy}} or {{MenuCommand|Edit → Duplicate selection}} for an object with dependencies there is a new {{Button|Use Original Selections}} button in the object selection dialog. Click this button to copy/duplicate only the objects you originally selected prior to opening the dialog, ignoring dependencies and ignoring any actions you might have taken while the dialog was open, such as checking or unchecking some of the checkboxes. The effect is the same as if you had unchecked all the checkboxes next to the objects you did not originally select and pressed OK. Note: special care should be taken when copying/duplicating TechDraw Pages. It is recommended to also copy/duplicate all children of the Page (Templates, Views, Dimensions, etc.). Otherwise changes to one Page will also impact the other page. For example, deleting a View on one Page also removes it from the other Page, or deleting a page will also remove all its content from the other Page.

<!--T:103-->
{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:PrefPacks_relnotes_0.20.png|384px]]
| A new type of add-on called a [[Preference_Packs|Preference Pack]] was added, allowing a subset of a user preferences file (user.cfg) to be saved, distributed, and easily applied by other users. Preference Packs can be use to distribute "Themes," for example, by allowing a developer to include both a Qt stylesheet for widgets as well as a set of other colors and styles for items in the user interface that cannot be set using a stylesheet (e.g. text colors in the Python editor or report view, etc.). Anything that can be configured via a user.cfg file can be set using a Preference Pack. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=62477 Forum discussion]

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:Autoload_relnotes_0.20.png|384px]]
| The "Workbenches" preference panel was modified to support the ability to "autoload" workbenches on FreeCAD startup.

<!--T:177-->
On Linux, the default location of FreeCAD's configuration, data and cache files was changed to follow the [https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html XDG Base Directory Specification]. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=63648 Forum discussion]. Here is a comparison of the old and new locations:

== Addon Manager == <!--T:22-->

<!--T:130-->
{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:AddonManagerExpanded_relnotes_0.20.png|400px]]
| The [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] was modified to support the distribution of Preference Packs, and to display information found in an addon's metadata. The Addon Manager also includes improved support for Addons whose source code is located at several different git hosting locations. Networking support was improved to provide more robust handling of SSL connections and support for proxies requiring authentication. Support was added for automatically adding macro buttons to the toolbar after installing, for disabling Addons without removing them, and for switching which git branch of an Addon is checked out. Finally, the user interface was modified to improve searching and display of different list filters.

<!--T:138-->
With the [[Image:Attach in SketchArch.svg|20px]] [https://github.com/paullee0/FreeCAD_SketchArch Attach Feature] it is now possible to place [[Image:Arch_Window.svg|20px|link=Arch_Window]] [[Arch_Window|Windows]] and [[Image:Arch_Equipment.svg|20px|link=Arch_Equipment]] [[Arch_Equipment|Equipment]] parametrically and intuitively in relation to [[Image:Arch_Wall.svg|20px|link=Arch_Wall]] [[Arch_Wall|Walls]].

<!--T:140-->
{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:NewArchStructureProperties_relnotes_0.20.jpg|250px]]
| '''New properties for Arch Structure objects''':

<!--T:141-->
* '''BasePerpendicularToTool''': it creates a copy of the Base (extrusion profile) at the beginning of the Tool (extrusion path) and places it perpendicular to the first edge of the tool. It is the same as attaching the Base with MapMode=NormalToEdge, but it is automatic and allows to reuse the same Base object for multiple Structures. When BasePerpendicularToTool = True, more properties control the placement of the Base relative to the Tool axis. They are shown in the attached image.

<!--T:142-->
* '''ToolOffsetFirst''' and '''ToolOffsetLast''': extend/trim the Structure at the start and end respectively (the real length of the Structure is available in the ComputedLength read-only property).

<!--T:170-->
* '''BaseRotation''': rotate the Base (the rotation is around the Base's "(0,0)" point which is the center for [[Arch_Profile|Arch Profiles]], the origin for Sketches and usually the first point for [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wires]]).

<!--T:171-->
* '''BaseOffsetX''' and '''BaseOffsetY''': move the Base (extrusion profile).

<!--T:172-->
* '''BaseMirror''': mirror the Base (extrusion profile).

<!--T:143-->
A new command '''Create multiple Arch Structure''' was also added. It uses the first selected object as a Base, and creates Arch Structures objects for every Edge of the other selected objects. Then, the properties of individual Structure objects can be adjusted in the Property editor. This command was added for workflow with a master Sketch (there is risk of topological naming problem unless you create non-parametric copy of the master Sketch or use Realthunder's version).

<!--T:160-->
Support for '''2D data''' such as linework, hatches, texts and dimensions is now enabled in IFC import and export, which contributes to making the IFC format more and more suitable for traditional 2D CAD work. A similar effort is being made in [https://blenderbim.org BlenderBIM]. More 2D workflow improvements are documented [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=563067#p563067 in this forum thread].

== Draft Workbench == <!--T:24-->

<!--T:84-->
* A {{MenuCommand|Global}} checkbox was added to the task panel of many drafting commands. Checking it allows input of coordinates in the global coordinate system even if the [[Draft_SelectPlane|working plane]] is not aligned with the global XY plane.

<!--T:85-->
* The [[File:Draft_Hatch.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Hatch|Draft Hatch]] command was introduced. It creates hatches on the faces of a selected object using patterns from AutoCAD PAT files.

<!--T:86-->
* The [[File:Draft_AddNamedGroup.svg|24px]] [[Draft_AddNamedGroup|Draft AddNamedGroup]] command was introduced. The [[File:Draft_AddToGroup.svg|24px]] [[Draft_AddToGroup|Draft AddToGroup]] command was extended with the same functionality.

<!--T:87-->
* Work on the [[File:Draft_SetStyle.svg|24px]] [[Draft_SetStyle|Draft SetStyle]] command, still in progress in FreeCAD version 0.19, was completed.

<!--T:88-->
* A double-click edit option was added for [[File:Draft_Text.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Text|Draft Texts]]. It opens the same edit task panel used when creating a text.

<!--T:89-->
* For [[File:Draft_Dimension.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Dimension|Draft Dimensions]] the {{Value|arch}} {{PropertyView|Unit Override}} for imperial architectural dimensions was introduced.

<!--T:90-->
* [[File:Draft_Shape2DView.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Shape2DView|Draft Shape2DView]] objects now have an {{PropertyData|Auto Update}} property. Setting it to {{False}} can be useful if there are many Draft Shape2DViews in a document or if they are complex.

<!--T:91-->
* It is now possible to reverse a [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]] via the [[File:Draft_Edit.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]] context menu. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=58643&start=20 Forum discussion], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4811 Pull request #4811].

=== Further Draft improvements === <!--T:25-->

<!--T:70-->
* Fixed [[Draft_Snap_Grid|Draft Snap Grid]] when the cursor is over a face. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=62274 Forum discussion]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/1761eb8ce Git commit].

<!--T:92-->
* New [[Draft_Text|Draft Texts]] are now aligned with the [[Draft_SelectPlane|working plane]], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5092 Pull request #5092].

=== Further FEM improvements === <!--T:28-->

<!--T:29-->
* '''Important:''' Starting from this release, FreeCAD will use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units SI units] (m, kg, s, K, A, mol, cd) to write the [[FEM_SolverElmer|Elmer solver]] input files (''case.sif'' and ''mesh.nodes''). This is independent of the used FreeCAD [[Preferences_Editor#Units|unit system]].
* '''Important:''' Starting from this release, the scale of [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|result pipelines]] and their [[FEM_Workbench#Menu:_Results|filters]] will use SI units (m, kg, s, K, A, mol, cd). So the displacement is given in meter, the stress in Pascal. This applies to all SI-derived FreeCAD [[Preferences_Editor#Units|unit systems]].
* Solving with the [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|Calculix]] solver now uses all CPU cores. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6374 Pull request #6374]
* Meshing with [[FEM_MeshGmshFromShape|Gmsh]] now uses all CPU cores. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6370 Pull request #6370]
* The element order of [[FEM_MeshGmshFromShape|Gmsh]] meshes can be changed via the mesh dialog. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4660 Pull request #4660]
* The [[FEM_PostFilterDataAtPoint|Data at point clip]] result filter is now actually working: One gets info from result meshes by clicking into them or by specifying a mesh coordinate.
* A new constraint was added: {{MenuCommand|Model → Mechanical Constraints → [[File:FEM_ConstraintCentrif.svg|16px]] [[FEM_ConstraintCentrif|Constraint Centrif]]}}. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4738 Pull request #4738]
* A new solver was added: {{MenuCommand|Solve → [[File:FEM_SolverMystran.svg|16px]] [[FEM_SolverMystran|Solver Mystran]]}}. Multiple commits.
* A new constraint was added: {{MenuCommand|Model → Mechanical Constraints → [[File:FEM_ConstraintSpring.svg|16px]] [[FEM_ConstraintSpring|Constraint Spring]]}}. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4982 Pull request #4982]
* It is now possible to have [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|result pipelines]] with several filters, where some take other filters as input, and some take the results directly from the pipeline. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/708a300b commit 708a300b]
* Material cards can now contain values for the electrical conductivity. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4647 Pull request #4647]
* Material cards added for Nitrogen and Argon. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4649 Pull request #4649]
* Support for the [[FEM_MeshGmshFromShape|Gmsh]] mesh algorithms ''"HXT"'' (3D) and ''"Packing Parallelograms"'' (2D) added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4654 Pull request #4654]
* Allow to specify an algorithm for the [[FEM_MeshGmshFromShape#Properties|Gmsh]] property ''"High Order Optimize"''. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4705 Pull request #4705]
* Nonlinear solid materials with simple hardening can now have an arbitrary number of yield points. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5024 Pull request #5024]
* Allow modal adding/removal of geometric entities to constraints acting on boundaries. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5117 Pull request #5117]
* Most FEM constraint dialogs now behave uniformly and provide the same 3D object selection features. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5391 Pull request #5391]

== Export == <!--T:154--> 

<!--T:155-->
* DXF: The missing unit block was added to the header14.rub file. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5793 Pull request #5793]

== Mesh == <!--T:32-->

=== Improved support for NASTRAN GRID elements === <!--T:94-->

<!--T:95-->
The Mesh import tool now supports the high-precision "GRID*" element. The standard-precision "GRID" element was also improved, now supporting both space-delimited numeric input as well as fixed-field-width input, per the NASTRAN95 format documentation.

=== Further Mesh improvements === <!--T:33-->

<!--T:79-->
Fixed false negatives during self-intersection tests when facets are coplanar: [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5002 Pull request #5002].

== OpenSCAD Workbench == <!--T:68-->

<!--T:69-->
Interoperability with OpenSCAD has been improved, adding support for several operations missing from earlier versions (linear extrude with rotations, rotational extrusions). Several operations are modified to provide improved FreeCAD object equivalents, particularly for twisted extrusions. Surface generation from discrete data was modified to give more OpenSCAD-like results, rather than splined surfaces.

<!--T:131-->
New options were added to support running either FreeCAD, OpenSCAD, or both, in sandboxed environments such as AppImages and Snap packages: data can now be transferred to and from OpenSCAD via the standard temporary directory mechanism, via a user-specified temp directory that both executables have access to, or new to OpenSCAD 2021.1, via a "stdout pipe" mechanism, bypassing temporary files entirely.

<!--T:77-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[Image:OpenSCAD_AddElement_relnotes_0.20.png|384px]]
| The following options were added to the task panel of the [[OpenSCAD_AddOpenSCADElement|Add OpenSCAD element]] feature:

=== Further Part improvements === <!--T:35-->

<!--T:36-->
* The dialog to edit [[Part_Cylinder|Cylinders]] now allows to specify an angle relative to the normal of the chosen attachment plane. This way one can create skew cylinders. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4708 Pull request #4708]
* The [[Part_ColorPerFace|Face Colors]] tool now also allows to set the transparency (''Alpha channel'') of faces. This transparency can be [[Import_Export|exported]], making e.g. STEP files with transparent parts possible.
* The following commands now support App::Links: [[Part_Loft|Loft]], [[Part_Sweep|Sweep]], [[Part_Extrude|Extrude]], [[Part_Revolve|Revolve]], [[Part_ReverseShape|Reverse shapes]], [[Part_Mirror|Mirror]], [[Part_Offset2D|Offset2D]], [[Part_Offset|Offset3D]], [[Part_CheckGeometry|Check Geometry]], [[Part_RuledSurface|Ruled Surface]], [[Part_CrossSections|Cross-sections]], and [[Part_Thickness|Thickness]].

* [[PartDesign_Chamfer|Chamfer]] and [[PartDesign_Fillet|Fillet]] dialogs now each have a new Use all edges checkbox, which is connected to the Use All Edges property for these objects. When the box is checked the property is set to True, when unchecked the property is set to False. When Use All Edges is True there is protection against the [[Topological_naming_problem|topological naming problem]] because then all of the edges of the base object are used regardless of how many edges there are. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5340 Pull request #5340]
* Plane selection when [[PartDesign_NewSketch|adding a new sketch]] can now be achieved with a single-click in the 3D View. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5408 Pull request] [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=65020 Forum discussion]

{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:TechDraw_ExtensionExample_relnotes_0.20.png|384px]]
| More than 30 new tools, so-called [[TechDraw_Workbench#Extensions|Extensions]], are now available. They offer new cosmetic features to enhance drawings.
|}

=== Further TechDraw improvements === <!--T:52-->

<!--T:106-->
* It is now possible to [[TechDraw_ShareView|Share]] and [[TechDraw_MoveView|Move]] [[TechDraw_Workbench#Views|Views]] between pages.
* When there are several [[TechDraw_PageDefault|Pages]] and a [[TechDraw_View|View]], [[TechDraw_ProjectionGroup|ProjectionGroup]] etc. is added, there is now a dialog to ask to what page the view should be added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5309 Pull request #5309].
* A new format specifier ''%w'' was added to print the given number of digits after dot and remove any trailing zeros. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/5401 Pull request #5401].
* The new ''%w'' format specifier is now the default. And the format specifier preference was moved from the Advanced tab to the Dimension tab. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6504 Pull request #6504].
* Flipped diagonal hatch was added for the [[TechDraw_GeometricHatch|Geometric Hatch]] tool. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6429 Pull request #6429].
* There is a new option to show a grid in a [[TechDraw_PageDefault|page]]. Several related [[TechDraw_Preferences#Grid|preferences]] have been introduced. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6465 Pull request #6465].
* The unit display in dimensions was fixed according to standards. The degree symbol is always present for the dimension value and tolerances, other units only appear if ShowUnits is set. The unit appears immediately after the dimension value unless there is a tolerance, then it appears after the tolerance. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6581 Pull request #6581]

== Web == <!--T:53-->

<!--T:148-->
Qt WebEngine is now considered the default option instead of Qt WebKit.

== External workbenches == <!--T:54-->

<!--T:104-->
{{Emphasis|Note:}} these are the new workbenches created in this development cycle, or older workbenches that received updates. See [[External_workbenches|external workbenches]] for more workbenches that can be installed, and which cover a wide variety of topics. If you want to see your workbench added, join the [https://forum.freecadweb.org/index.php forum] and present your code.

=== A2plus === <!--T:56-->

<!--T:161-->
Several features to view, inspect and edit existing constraints were added. One can now e.g. highlight constraints with a label, suppress a constraint temporarily or run the solver only for a particular constraint.

<!--T:162-->
For more information see [[A2plus_Workbench#Constraint_Handling|the constraint handling description]].

=== Assembly3 === <!--T:57-->

<!--T:163-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Asm3_relnotes_0.20.jpg|384px]]
| The Assembly3 Workbench is available (as of March 2022) through the [[Std_AddonMgr|AddonManager]]. This makes for easy installation and management of the external dependencies of the workbench.

<!--T:164-->
Assembly3 is used to create assemblies of different bodies contained in a single file or in multiple documents leveraging the full power of FreeCAD’s Link system. Learn more about [[App_Link|Links]] in this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTDkJ7JZAWs video presentation] from Realthunder.

<!--T:165-->
Assembly3 Workbench uses [https://solvespace.com SolveSpace] as it’s solver.

<!--T:166-->
Extensive documentation can be found at the main FreeCAD [[Assembly3|Assembly3 wiki]] page or Realthunder's GitHub [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki Assembly3 wiki]
|-
| [[File:Asm3_1_relnotes_0.20.jpg|384px]]
| '''Main features:'''
* Dynamic/interactive solver: move parts with the mouse while the solver constrains the motion.
* Links: use one single part multiple times in an assembly.
* External links: allows usage of parts from external documents.
* Hierarchical assemblies: permits the creation of sub assemblies.
* Assembly freeze: assemblies that are not required to remain dynamic can be excluded from calculations and are considered fixed geometry by the asm3 solver.
* And much more.

=== Assembly4 === <!--T:58-->

<!--T:167-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[Image:A4_veriant-beam_relnotes_0.20.png|384px]]</br>Different length of a beam as variant.
| New feature to add variants. These are [[App_Link|links]] to a part with varying parameters, meaning that you can insert the same part several times, and adjust the parameters of each instance. For more info see [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=538666#p538666 this forum thread].

=== FCGear === <!--T:100-->

<!--T:101-->
The [[FCGear_Workbench|FCGear Workbench]] received a couple of improvements:

<!--T:102-->
* For involute gears, the outside (aka tip) and root diameter are exposed as properties ([https://github.com/looooo/freecad.gears/pull/69 details]).
* Gear objects are now [[Part_EditAttachment|attachable]] ([https://github.com/looooo/freecad.gears/pull/72 details]).
* Gear objects can now be used as additive features in PartDesign Bodies ([https://github.com/looooo/freecad.gears/pull/74 details]).
* The creation of gear objects now appears in the undo stack ([https://github.com/looooo/freecad.gears/pull/83 details]).

=== Plot === <!--T:149-->

<!--T:150-->
* The Plot module has been stripped from the [[Plot_Workbench|Plot Workbench]] since it is now provided by FreeCAD.

=== Ship === <!--T:151-->

<!--T:152-->
The [[Ship_Workbench|Ship Workbench]] is back to life!

<!--T:153-->
* A new tool to compute the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/freecad.ship#static-sink-and-trim static sink and trim] has been added.
* A new tool to compute the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/freecad.ship#raos response amplitude operators] has been added on top of [https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine capytaine].

== Compilation == <!--T:11-->

<!--T:107-->
Since this release FreeCAD can only be compiled using Qt 5.x and Python 3.x. The lowest supported Python version is 3.6.9 according to [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=62701 this forum thread].

<!--T:12-->
To compile FreeCAD see the instructions for [[Compile_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Compile_on_Linux|Linux]] and [[Compile_on_MacOS|MacOS]].

<!--T:81-->
The supported operating systems are:
* Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11
* Linux Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04) and Focal Fossa (20.04)
* MacOS: 10.12 Sierra or newer

== Known Limitations == <!--T:15-->

===32-bit Windows=== <!--T:156-->

<!--T:157-->
Since FreeCAD 0.19 we no longer officially support 32-bit Windows. FreeCAD might work on these systems, but no support is given.

===Remote Desktop under Windows=== <!--T:158-->

<!--T:159-->
Depending on the OpenGL graphics capabilities of a computer, it might be that one encounters a crash when running FreeCAD via remote desktop. To fix this upgrade your OpenGL driver.
Only if this doesn't help:
* Download [https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=mesa64-latest this] OpenGL library for 64bit Windows and extract it.
* Rename the DLL file to ''opengl32sw.dll'' and copy it to the ''bin'' subfolder of FreeCAD's installation folder (overwrite the existing DLL there).

===MacOS: Start Workbench shows blank page=== <!--T:179-->

<!--T:180-->
If the [[Start_Workbench|Start Workbench]] shows only a blank page, you must enable the option '''Use software OpenGL''' in the menu {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → Display}}.
