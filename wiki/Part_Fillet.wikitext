== Description == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:7-->
'''Part Fillet''' creates fillets (rounds) on the selected edges of a shape. A dialog allows choosing which shape and which edges to work on.

==Usage== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:8-->
# Optionally select one or more edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Fillet.svg|16px]] Fillet...}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_Fillet.svg|16px]] Fillet...}} option from the menu.
# The '''Fillet Edges''' [[Task_panel|task panel]] opens.
#* Optionally (re-) select an item in the '''Selected shapes''' list in the '''Shape''' section or in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
#* Edit the fillet parameters.
# Press {{Button|OK}} to close the task panel and apply the fillet.

== Part Fillet VS. PartDesign Fillet == <!--T:15-->

<!--T:5-->
There is another fillet tool in the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px|link=PartDesign_Workbench]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign workbench]]. Please note that their operation is quite different. Check out the [[Image:PartDesign_Fillet.svg|24px|link=PartDesign_Fillet]] [[PartDesign_Fillet|PartDesign Fillet]] reference page for more details on their differences.

== Notes on application of Part Fillet == <!--T:16-->

<!--T:6-->
Part Fillet might do nothing if the result would touch or cross the next adjacent edge. Consequently, if you do not obtain the expected result, try with a smaller '''Radius''' value. This is the same for [[Image:Part_Chamfer.svg|24px]] [[Part_Chamfer|Part Chamfer]].

<!--T:13-->
The fillet tool sometimes fails when trying to fillet complex shapes. A common cause of this may be that the shape being filleted is not geometrically correct. This may be the result of lines/planes etc not being removed after previous operations used to construct the shape ( e.g. Cut/Intersection/Fusion). A number of steps can be used to minimize problems:
* Where possible leave filleting a part until the part is completely generated. This will minimize interaction of fillets with subsequent Boolean operations;
* Use the {{MenuCommand|Part → Check Geometry}} to check for any errors in the shape geometry and correct;
* Use {{MenuCommand|Part → Create a copy → Refine shape}} to remove any artifacts introduced by previous Boolean operations before filleting (and in some cases between filleting operations in sequence);
* Consider using {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → PartDesign}} to enable automatic checking and refining of the model after Boolean and sketch based operations (performance may be affected if these options are left switched on). 

<!--T:14-->
The fillet tool is affected by the [[Topological_naming_problem|topological naming problem]] when making a change to a modeling step earlier in the chain that affects the number of faces or vertices. This could cause unpredictable results. Until this problem is resolved it is advised to apply chamfer and fillet operations as the last steps in the modelling chain.
