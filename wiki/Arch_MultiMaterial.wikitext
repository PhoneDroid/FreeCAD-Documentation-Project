== Description == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
The Multi-Material tool defines a list of [[Material|materials]] with, for each material, a name and a thickness value. This multi-materials list can then be added to an [[Arch_Workbench|Arch]] object instead of a single [[Arch SetMaterial|Arch Material]] .

<!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
Not all Arch objects can currently make use of multi-materials, and the use they do of it differs. Currently:

<!--T:6-->
* [[Image:Arch_Wall.svg|24px]] [[Arch Wall|Walls]] with a MultiMaterial will use the material definitions and thicknesses to create a multi-layer wall
* [[Image:Arch_Window.svg|24px]] [[Arch Window|Windows]] with a MultiMaterial will attribute materials with a given name defined inside the MultiMaterial to window components with a same name or type (see below). Material thickness is not considered.
* [[Image:Arch_Panel.svg|24px]] [[Arch Panel|Panels]] with a MultiMaterial will use the material definitions and thicknesses to create a multi-layer panel

==Usage== <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
# Create first a series of {{Button|[[Image:Arch SetMaterial.svg|16px]] [[Arch SetMaterial|Arch Materials]]}} that you will need in your Multi-Material.
# Optionally, select an Arch object you wish to attribute the new Multi-Material to.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Arch MultiMaterial.svg|16px]] [[Arch MultiMaterial|Multi-Material]]}} button.
# Set the desired material layers.

== Options == <!--T:9-->

<!--T:11-->
Upon creating or editing a multi-material by double-clicking it in the tree, the following options are available:

<!--T:12-->
* '''Duplicate''' another existing Multi-Material from the same document. This only copies the values over, and doesn't link the two multi-materials in any way.
* The '''Name''' field will also set the material object's Label
* The '''Composition''' list is the list of the different material layers that compose this multi-material. Each layer has a name, a material and a thickness value.
* Click {{Button|Add}} to add a new layer, {{Button|Up}} to move a selected layer up, {{Button|Down}} to move a selected layer down, or {{Button|Del}} to delete a selected layer.
* Double-click the '''name''' of a layer to edit it, the material will offer you a drop-down list of available [[Arch SetMaterial|Arch Materials]] in the same document, and thickness can be set to any value in any unit
* Name and Material fields are mandatory. Thickness can be left blank (it will then adopt a value of 0).
* When a multi-material contains layers with a thickness of zero, that thickness is considered variable. Arch objects that use the multi-material, such as Walls and Panels, will treat that accordingly, and give that layer the remaining space available given their own width or thickness.
* If you name the different components of a multi-material "Frame", "Solid panel", "Glass panel" or "Louvre", and apply that material to a window, the given materials will be applied to the corresponding window components.

== Relation to IFC == <!--T:20-->

This roughly corresponds to a combination of [https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/DEV/IFC4_2/FINAL/HTML/link/ifcmateriallayerset.htm IfcMaterialLayerSet] and [https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/DEV/IFC4_2/FINAL/HTML/link/ifcmateriallayer.htm IfcMaterialLayer].
