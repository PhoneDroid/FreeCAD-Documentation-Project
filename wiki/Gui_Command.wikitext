<!--T:1-->
The GuiCommand is one of the most important functions of FreeCAD in the main interaction point of the user. Every time the user selects a menu item or presses a toolbar button it activates a GuiCommand. Some of the attributes of a GuiCommand are:
* Defines a name
* Contains an icon
* Defines the scope for an undo/redo
* Has a help page
* Opens and controls dialogs
* Macro recording
* and others.

== Naming == <!--T:19-->

<!--T:2-->
The GuiCommand is named in a standard way: ''ModuleName_CommandName'' e.g., "[[Base_Open|Base_Open]]" this is the Open Gui Command in the Base system. The GuiCommand in a certain module is named with the module name in front e.g., "[[Part_Cylinder|Part_Cylinder]]". 

<!--T:3-->
If the documentation is not finished use [[Template:UnfinishedDocu]].

== Help page == <!--T:20-->

<!--T:4-->
Every GuiCommand has to have a help page. The help page is hosted on the FreeCAD documentation wiki. The article has the same name as the GuiCommand, e.g. [[Draft_ShapeString|Draft ShapeString]].

<!--T:5-->
To create your own help pages you can use the template [[GuiCommand_model|GuiCommand model]]

<!--T:6-->
Example:
* [[Draft_ShapeString|Draft ShapeString]]
* [[Draft_Line|Draft Line]]

== Icons == <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
Every GuiCommand has to have an icon. We use the [http://tango-project.org/Tango_Desktop_Project/ Tango icon set] and its guidelines. On the right side you see the tango color palette. 

<!--T:9-->
All icons should be created in [[SVG|SVG]] format with a vector image application, such as [http://inkscape.org Inkscape]. This makes it easier to apply changes and derive additional icons in the same application space.

===Icons color coding chart=== <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->

<!--T:12-->
We try as much as possible to respect this chart, so the color of the icons has a direct meaning.
