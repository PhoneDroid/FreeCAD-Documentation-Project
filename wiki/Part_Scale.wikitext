== Description == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
'''Part Scale''' scales shapes by a specified factor in all directions or by distinct factors in each cardinal direction. In the case of distinct factors, the shapes may be distorted.

<!--T:21-->
Scaling occurs relative to the global coordinate system. To scale relative to the placement of the source object create a [[Std_LinkMake|Link]] or a [[Draft_Clone|Draft Clone]] instead.

==Usage== <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
# Select one or more shapes in the [[3D_view|3D view]] or in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Scale.svg|16px]] [[Part_Scale|Scale...]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_Scale.svg|16px]] Scale...}} option from the menu.
# A [[#Task_panel|tasks panel]] opens.
# Choose {{MenuCommand|Uniform Scaling}} or {{MenuCommand|Non-Uniform Scaling}}.
# Set the scaling factor(s).
# Click {{Button|OK}}.

<!--T:8-->
Alternatively, the selection can be done after launching the command, by selecting one or more shapes from the list in the [[#Task_panel|tasks panel]]. 

<!--T:9-->
The Tree view will list as many Scale objects as there were selected shapes. Each input shape is placed underneath its Scale object.

<!--T:11-->
* {{Button|OK}} button creates the scaled object, and closes the task panel.
* {{Button|Close}} button closes the task panel without doing anything.
* {{Button|Apply}} button creates the scaled objects, but does not close the task panel. You can then select another shape from the list at the bottom, and create more scaled objects.
* {{MenuCommand|Shape}} list: here you select which shapes to scale. If multiple shapes are selected, multiple Scale objects are created.

== Notes == <!--T:12--> 

<!--T:13-->
* Non-uniform scaling will turn all edges into B-spline curves, and all faces into B-spline surfaces. These are computationally heavier.
* Points/Vertices can not be scaled as they are dimensionless.
* [[App_Link|App Link]] objects linked to the appropriate object types and [[App_Part|App Part]] containers with the appropriate visible objects inside can also be scaled.
* The task panel does not offer a preview yet. {{Button|Apply}} will create a scaled object every time you click it, which can be useful as preview. They will however remain and yet another scaled object will be created as you click {{Button|OK}}. [[Std_Undo|Undo]] can be useful to clean them up before clicking {{Button|OK}}.

== Properties == <!--T:14-->

<!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
A Part Scale object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data === <!--T:17-->

<!--T:18-->
{{TitleProperty|Scale}}

<!--T:19-->
* {{PropertyData|Base|Link}}: The input shape (the shape upon which the Part Scale was applied).
* {{PropertyData|Uniform|Bool}}: Controls uniform vs non-uniform scaling
* {{PropertyData|Uniform Scale|Float}}: The scale factor for uniform scaling
* {{PropertyData|XScale|Float}}: The X scale factor for non-uniform scaling.
* {{PropertyData|YScale|Float}}: The Y scale factor, idem.
* {{PropertyData|ZScale|Float}}: The Z scale factor, idem.
