==Description==

A tool to create more complex shapes from various parametric geometric primitives.

==Usage==

This tool can create the following objects: 

===Edge from two vertices===

#Select two vertices
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
[[Image:Edge from verts-1.gif]]

===Wire from edges=== 

#Select a set of adjacent edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
[[File:Wire_from_edges-1.gif]]

===Face from vertices===

#Select vertices bounding the face in the [[3D_view|3D view]]
#Select if face should be planar
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
#Object will be created in [[3D_view|3D view]] and will be listed in [[Tree_view|tree view]]
[[File:Face_from_verts.gif]]

===Face from edges===

#Select a closed set of edges bounding the face in the [[3D_view|3D view]]
#Select if face should be planar
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
#Object will be created in [[3D_view|3D view]] and will be listed in [[Tree_view|tree view]]
[[File:Face_from_edges.gif]]

===Shell from faces===

#Select faces in the [[3D_view|3D view]]
#Select if the shape should be refined
#Select if all faces should be included in shell
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
#Object will be created in [[3D_view|3D view]] and will be listed in [[Tree_view|tree view]]

===Solid from shell===

#Select if the shape should be refined
#Click on {{Button|Create}}
#Object will be created in [[3D_view|3D view]] and will be listed in [[Tree_view|tree view]]

==Notes==

A possible workflow could be:
* Draw a wireframe-model of your shape using the tools in the [[Image:Workbench_Draft.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] (for example line and dwire)
* Create all faces with "face from edges"
* Create a "shell from faces"
* Create a "solid from shell"
