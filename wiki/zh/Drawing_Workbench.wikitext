The [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]] is its more advanced replacement.}}

== Introduction == 

The Drawing module allows you to put your 3D work on paper. That is, to put views of your models in a 2D window and to insert that window in a drawing, for example a sheet with a border, a title and your logo and finally print that sheet.

== Tools ==

These are tools for creating, configuring and exporting 2D drawing sheets

* [[Image:Drawing_New.png|32px]] [[Drawing_Open_SVG|Open scalable vector graphic]]: Opens a drawing sheet previously saved as an SVG file

* [[Image:Drawing_Landscape_A3.png|32px]] [[Drawing_Landscape_A3|New A3 landscape drawing]]: Creates a new drawing sheet from FreeCAD's default A3 template

* [[Image:Drawing_View.png|32px]] [[Drawing_View|Insert a view]]: Inserts a view of the selected object in the active drawing sheet

* [[Image:Drawing_Annotation.png|32px]] [[Drawing_Annotation|Annotation]]: Adds an annotation to the current drawing sheet

* [[Image:Drawing_Clip.png|32px]] [[Drawing_Clip|Clip]]: Adds a clip group to the current drawing sheet

* [[Image:Drawing_Openbrowser.png|32px]] [[Drawing_Openbrowser|Open Browser]]: Opens a preview of the current sheet in the browser

* [[Image:Drawing_Orthoviews.png|32px]] [[Drawing_Orthoviews|Ortho Views]]: Automatically creates orthographic views of an object on the current drawing sheet

* [[Image:Drawing_Symbol.png|32px]] [[Drawing_Symbol|Symbol]]: Adds the contents of a SVG file as a symbol on the current drawing sheet

* [[Image:Drawing_DraftView.png|32px]] [[Draft_Drawing|Draft View]]: Inserts a special Draft view of the selected object in the current drawing sheet

* [[Image:Drawing_SpreadsheetView.png|32px]] [[Drawing_SpreadsheetView|Spreadsheet View]]: Inserts a view of a selected spreadsheet in the current drawing sheet

* [[Image:Drawing_Save.png|32px]] [[Drawing_Save|Save sheet]]: Saves the current sheet as a SVG file

* [[Drawing_ProjectShape|Project Shape]]: Creates a projection of the selected object (Source) in the 3D view.

* {{Emphasis|Note:}} the [[Draft Drawing|Draft Drawing]] tool is used with [[Draft Workbench|Draft objects]]. It has some additional capabilities over the Drawing tools, and supports specific objects like [[Draft Dimension|Draft dimensions]].

== Workflow ==
The document contains a 3D shape object (leg) from which we want to produce a drawing. Therefore a "Page" is created. A page it's instantiated from a template, for example, the "A3_Landscape" template. The template is an [[SVG|SVG]] document which can hold a page frame, a logo, and other elements.

In this page we can insert one or more views. Each view has a position on the page, a scale factor, and additional properties. Every time the page or the view or the referenced object changes, the page is regenerated and the page display updated.

== Scripting ==

At the moment the graphical user interface workflow is very limited, so the scripting API is more interesting.

See the [[Drawing API example]] page for a description of the functions used to create drawing pages and views.

== Extending the Drawing Module ==

Some notes on the programming side of the drawing module will be added to the [[Drawing Documentation]] page. This is to help quickly understand how the drawing module works, enabling programmers to rapidly start programming for it.
