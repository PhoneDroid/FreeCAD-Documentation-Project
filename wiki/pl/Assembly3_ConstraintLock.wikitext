== Description ==

This tool links an object to the global coordinate system (GCS) of the assembly using the implicit coordinate system (ICS) of a selected element.
:- If a vertex is selected the coordinates of its ICS are fixed relative to the GCS. 
::The object can still rotate around the vertex.
:- If a (straight) edge is selected the coordinates of its ICS and the direction of its z-axis are fixed relative to the GCS. 
::The object can still rotate around the edge.
:- If a face is selected the coordinates and the orientation of its ICS are fixed relative to the GCS. 
::The object is completely fixed to the GCS.

This can be used to define the fixed set in a static assembly as well as in a kinematic system.

== Usage == 

# Place an object into an assembly.
# Select one element of the object.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Assembly_ConstraintLock.svg|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintLock|Locked]]}} button.
