==Overview==

The FreeCAD source code is commented to allow automatic programming documentation generation using [[Doxygen|Doxygen]], a popular source code documentation system. Doxygen can document both the C++ and Python parts of FreeCAD, resulting in HTML pages with hyperlinks to each documented function and class.

The documentation is hosted online at the [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ FreeCAD API website]. Please note that this documentation may not always be up to date; if you need more details, download FreeCAD's latest source code and compile the documentation yourself. If you have pressing questions about the code please ask in the developer section of the [https://forum.freecad.org/index.php FreeCAD forum].

Compiling the API documentation follows the same general steps as compiling the FreeCAD executable, as indicated in the [[Compile_on_Linux|Compile on Linux]] page.

CMake configures the system so that with a single make instruction the documentation for the the entire project is compiled into many HTML files with diagrams.}}

== Build source documentation ==

=== Complete documentation ===

If you have Doxygen installed, it is very easy to build the documentation. Also install [https://www.graphviz.org/ Graphviz] to be able to produce diagrams showing the relationships between different classes and libraries in the FreeCAD code. Graphviz is also used by FreeCAD's [[Std_DependencyGraph|dependency graph]] to show the relationships between different objects.

{{Code|code=
sudo apt install doxygen graphviz
}}

Then follow the same steps you would do to compile FreeCAD, as described on the [[Compile_on_Linux|compile on Linux]] page, and summarized here for convenience.
* Get the source code of FreeCAD and place it in its own directory {{incode|freecad-source}}.
* Create another directory {{incode|freecad-build}} in which you will compile FreeCAD and its documentation.
* Configure the sources with {{incode|cmake}}, making sure you indicate the source directory, and specify the required options for your build.
* Trigger the creation of the documentation using {{incode|make}}.

{{Code|code=
git clone https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD.git freecad-source
mkdir freecad-build
cd freecad-build
cmake -DBUILD_QT5=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 ../freecad-source
}}

While you are inside the build directory issue the following instruction to create only the documentation.

{{Code|code=
make -j$(nproc --ignore=2) DevDoc
}}

As mentioned in [[Compiling_(Speeding_up)|compiling (speeding up)]], the {{incode|-j}} option sets the number of CPU cores used for compilation. The resulting documentation files will appear in the directory

{{Code|code=
freecad-build/doc/SourceDocu/html/
}}

The point of entrance to the documentation is the {{incode|index.html}} file, which you can open with a web browser:

{{Code|code=
xdg-open freecad-build/doc/SourceDocu/html/index.html
}}

The {{incode|DevDoc}} target will generate a significant amount of data, around 5 GB of new files, particularly due to the diagrams created by Graphviz.

=== Reduced documentation ===

The complete documentation uses around 3Gb of disk space. An alternative, smaller version of the documentation which takes only around 600 MB can be generated with a different target. This is the version displayed on the [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ FreeCAD API website].

{{Code|code=
make -j$(nproc --ignore=2) WebDoc
}}

The documentation on the [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ FreeCAD API website] is produced automatically from https://github.com/FreeCAD/SourceDoc. Anyone can rebuild it and submit a pull request:

* Fork the repo at https://github.com/FreeCAD/SourceDoc
* on your machine: clone the FreeCAD code (if you haven't yet), create a build dir for the doc, and clone the above SourceDoc repo inside. That SourceDoc will be updated when you rebuild the doc, and you'll be able to commit & push the results afterwards:

{{Code|code=
git clone https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD
cd FreeCAD
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir -p doc/SourceDocu/html
cd doc/SourceDocu/html
git clone your-fork-url
cd ../../..
cmake -DBUILD_QT5=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 ..
make WebDoc
cd doc/SourceDocu/html
git commit
git push
}}

* Go to your fork online, and create a pull request.

== Other versions ==

[https://iesensor.com/FreeCADDoc/0.19/ FreeCAD 0.19 development] documentation built by [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=12613 qingfeng.xia].

== Integrate Coin3D documentation ==

On Unix systems it is possible to link Coin3D source documentation with FreeCAD's. This allows for easier navigation and complete inheritance diagrams for Coin derived classes.

*Install the {{incode|libcoin-doc}}, {{incode|libcoin80-doc}}, or similarly named package.
*Unpack the archive {{incode|coin.tar.gz}} located in {{incode|/usr/share/doc/libcoin-doc/html}}; the files may be already unpacked in your system.
*Generate again the source documentation.

If you don't install the documentation package for Coin, the links will be generated to access the online documentation at [https://coin3d.bitbucket.io/Coin/ BitBucket]. This will happen if a Doxygen tag file can be downloaded at configure time with {{incode|wget}}.

== Using Doxygen ==

See the [[Doxygen|Doxygen]] page for an extensive explanation on how to comment C++ and Python source code so that it can be processed by Doxygen to automatically create the documentation.

Essentially, a comment block, starting with {{incode|/**}} or {{incode|///}} for C++, or {{incode|##}} for Python, needs to appear before every class or function definition, so that it is picked up by Doxygen. Many [[Doxygen#Doxygen markup|special commands]], which start with {{incode|\}} or {{incode|@}}, can be used to define parts of the code and format the output. [[Doxygen#Markdown support|Markdown syntax]] is also understood within the comment block, which makes it convenient to emphasize certain parts of the documentation.

/**
 * Set the name to the workbench object.
 */
void setName(const std::string&);
