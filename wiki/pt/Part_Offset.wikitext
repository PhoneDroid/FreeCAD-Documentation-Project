==Description==

The [[Image:Part_Offset.svg|24px]] '''Part Offset''' tool creates parallel copies of a selected shape at a certain distance from the base shape, giving a new object.

[[Image:PartOffset0.png|400x200px]]  →  [[Image:PartOffset1.png|400x200px]]

==Usage==

# Select an object to offset.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Offset.svg|16px]] [[Part_Offset|3D Offset]]}} button.
# Adjust distance and parameters depending on the original object and the resulting objects validity.

==Notes==

* [[App_Link|App Link]] objects linked to the appropriate object types and [[App_Part|App Part]] containers with the appropriate visible objects inside can also be used as source objects. {{Version|0.20}}

==Examples==

[[Image:PartOffset0.png|x200px]]  →  [[Image:PartOffset1.png|x200px]]

Object with small offset and rounded (arc) corners.

[[Image:PartOffset3.png|x200px]] 

Same object with sharp (intersection) corners.

[[Image:PartOffset2.png|x200px]] 

Same object with thick distance overfilling the front left gap and allowed intersections.

[[Image:PartOffset4.png|x200px]] 

Arbitrary shape ([[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]]) with a 3D Offset (ignores MODE parameter).

[[Image:PartOffset5.png|x200px]] 

Same shape with a 3D Offset as SKIN and ''filled'' offset.

[[Image:PartOffset6.png|x200px]] 

''filled'' offset with 2 Cylinders creating boolean cuts. Cylinder A goes through the FILL whilst Cylinder B only goes through the FILL and NOT through the source 2D shape.

==Properties== 

* {{PropertyData|Offset}}: Distance to offset the faces of the shape.
* {{PropertyData|Mode}}: Mode of creation. ''Skin'' creates a new shape around the source shape. ''Pipe'' (todo). ''RectoVerso'' (todo).
* {{PropertyData|Join type}}: How the new corners are build up. ''Intersection'' gives sharp corners by linear extension of the edges. ''Arc'' and ''Tangent'' give rounded corners.

# Option: Intersection: Allows offsets pointing inwards to "overflow" the gap by intersecting the resulting shape until opposite faces are reached. 
# Option: Self Intersection: (todo).
# Option: Fill Offset: When the shape was 2 dimensional, the gap between the 2 shapes gets filled. The fill is now a solid, hence the source shape is not a solid. Thus boolean operations may lead to strange results. (see example below).
