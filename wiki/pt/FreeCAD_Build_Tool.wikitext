==Overview==
The '''FreeCAD build tool''' or '''fcbt''' is a python script located at
{{Code|code=
trunc/src/Tools/fcbt.py
}}
It can be used to simplify some frequent tasks in building, distributing and extending FreeCAD.

== Usage ==
With [[wikipedia:Python (programming language)|Python]] correctly installed, ''fcbt'' can be invoked by the command
{{Code|code=
python fbct.py
}}
It displays a menu, where you can select the task you want to use it for:
{{Code|code=
FreeCAD Build Tool
 Usage:
    fcbt <command name> [command parameter]
 possible commands are:
  - DistSrc         (DS)   Build a source Distr. of the current source tree
  - DistBin         (DB)   Build a binary Distr. of the current source tree
  - DistSetup       (DI)   Build a Setup Distr. of the current source tree
  - DistSetup       (DUI)  Build a User Setup Distr. of the current source tree
  - DistAll         (DA)   Run all three above modules
  - NextBuildNumber (NBN)  Increase the Build Number of this Version
  - CreateModule    (CM)   Insert a new FreeCAD Module (Workbench) in the module directory
 
 For help on the modules type:
   fcbt <command name> ?
}}
At the input prompt enter the abbreviated command you want to call. For example type "CM" for [[Workbench_creation|creating a module]].
