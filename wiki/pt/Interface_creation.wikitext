== Introduction ==

Power users have the possibility of [[Interface_creation|creating interfaces]] to help them produce complex tools for their custom [[Addon|addons]], such as [[Macros|macros]] or full [[Workbenches|workbenches]].

Interfaces are created using [[PySide|PySide]], which is a library for using Qt with [[Python|Python]].

{{Caption|Two general methods to create interfaces, by including the interface in the Python file, or by using {{incode|.ui}} files.}}

== Description ==

There are typically two ways of creating interfaces with PySide.

=== Interface in a .ui file ===

In this method the interface is defined in a {{incode|.ui}} file (an XML document that defines the structure of the interface), which is then imported into [[Python|Python]] code that uses it. This is the recommended approach.
* It allows the programmer to work with the graphical interface separately from the logic that will use it.
* It allows anybody to look at the interface alone, that is, the {{incode|.ui}} file, without having to run Python code.
* The {{incode|.ui}} file may be designed by anybody without programming knowledge.
* The {{incode|.ui}} interface can be used in a standalone window (modal), or in an embedded window (non-modal); therefore, this method is ideal to create custom [[Task_panel|task panels]].
* Since the {{incode|.ui}} file just describes the "appearance" of the interface, it does not need to be tied to a particular programming language; it may be used both in [[Python|Python]] and C++ code.

=== Interface completely in Python code ===

In this method the entire interface is defined by several Python calls.
* This is an older way of working with interfaces.
* This method produces very verbose code because many details of the interface need to be specified by hand.
* It is not simple to separate the interface from the logic that uses that code, meaning that a user would need to run the [[Python|Python]] file in the correct context in order to see how the interface would look.
* This method has the advantage that several interfaces may be contained within a single document, at the expense of making the file very large.
* This method is recommended only for small interfaces that don't define more than a few widgets, for example in [[Macros|macros]].

For examples on this method see [[Dialog_creation|Interface creation completely in Python]].
