The [[Report view|Report view]] is a panel that shows text messages from FreeCAD processes and tools. It is available in the menu {{MenuCommand|{{StdMenu|[[Std View Menu|View]]}} → Panels → Report view}}.

Certain properties of this panel, like color of the text and whether to display it automatically on warnings or errors, can be configured in the {{MenuCommand|General → Report view}} tab of the  [[Preferences_Editor#Report_view|Preferences Editor]].

== Messages ==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[Console API|Console API]], and [[FreeCAD Scripting Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

The report view displays messages from the internal FreeCAD {{incode|Console}} class.
* {{incode|FreeCAD.Console.PrintMessage("text")}}, print any sort of informative message, that doesn't imply any misbehavior; for example, print the coordinates of points, the result of a distance calculation, the number of vertices in a shape, etc. By default, in black color.
* {{incode|FreeCAD.Console.PrintWarning("text")}}, print messages that are intended to warn the user about strange behavior in the application. Warnings should be shown when some functionality is missing but the software still works acceptably. By default, in yellow color.
* {{incode|FreeCAD.Console.PrintError("text")}}, print messages that are intended to be error messages, that is, when a critical component is missing that makes a certain operation fail. By default, in red color.
* {{incode|FreeCAD.Console.PrintLog("text")}}, print messages that are going into the logs. These messages could be anything that is valuable to troubleshoot a problem in the future by reading the logs, for example, starting or closing a workbench. By default, in blue color.

These functions can be used from the [[Python console|Python console]] directly, or from [[Macros|macros]] and custom workbenches.
