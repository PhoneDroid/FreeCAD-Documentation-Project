{{Manual:TOC}}

O FreeCAD usa a licença [https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License LGPL]; você pode baixa-lo, instalar, redistribuir e usar o FreeCAD da maneira que desejar, independentemente do tipo de trabalho que fizer com ele (comercial ou não comercial), você não estará sujeito a nenhuma cláusula ou restrição, e os arquivos que você produzir com ele são totalmente seus. A única coisa que a licença proíbe, na verdade, é alegar que você mesmo programou o FreeCAD!

O FreeCAD se comporta da mesma forma no Windows, Mac OS e Linux. Porém, a maneira de instalar depender do sistema operacional que seu computador trabalha. Para Windows e Mac, a comunidade FreeCAD disponibiliza instaladores (pacotes pré-compilados) para download; já no Linux, você pode preferir usar o gerenciador de aplicativos (pacotes) favorito, isso por que, os mantenedores das principais distribuições Linux, tem pessoas responsáveis por compilar, empacotar e manter atualizados programas como o FreeCAD em conjunto com suas bibliotecas e dependências, afim de garantir uma perfeita estabilidade do aplicativo com sua distribuição.

A página oficial para baixar o FreeCAD para Windows e Mac OS é https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases

'''Versões do FreeCAD'''

The official releases of FreeCAD, that you can find on the page referenced above and in your distribution's software manager, are stable versions. However, the development of FreeCAD is fast! New features and bug fixes are added almost every single day. Since it is often a long time between stable releases, you might be interested in trying a more bleeding-edge version of FreeCAD. These development versions, or pre-releases, are uploaded from time to time to the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases download page] mentioned above, or, if you are using Ubuntu or Fedora, the FreeCAD community also maintains [https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily PPA] (Personal Package Archives) and [https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/groups/g/freecad/coprs/ copr] 'daily builds' which are regularly updated with the most recent changes.

=== Instalando no Windows ===

# Download an installer (.exe) package corresponding to your version of Windows (32bit or 64bit) from  the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases download page]. The FreeCAD installers should work on any windows version starting from Windows 7.
# Double-click the downloaded installer.
# Accept the terms of the LGPL license, this will be one of the few cases where you can really, safely click the "accept" button without reading the text. No hidden clauses: [[Image:Freecad-windows-install-01.jpg|none]]
# You can leave the default path here, or change if you wish: [[Image:Freecad-windows-install-02.jpg|none]]
# No need to set the PYTHONPATH variable, unless you plan to do some advanced python programming, in which case you probably already know what this is for: [[Image:Freecad-windows-install-03.jpg|none]]
# During the installation, a couple of additional components, which are bundled inside the installer, will be installed too: [[Image:Freecad-windows-install-04.jpg|none]]
# That's it, FreeCAD is installed. You will find it in your start menu. [[Image:Freecad-windows-install-05.jpg|none]]

'''Installing a development version'''

Packaging FreeCAD and creating an installer takes some time and dedication, so usually development (also called pre-release) versions are provided as .zip (or .7z) archives. These don't need to be installed; just unpack them and launch FreeCAD by double-clicking the FreeCAD.exe file that you will find inside. This also allows you to keep both the stable and "unstable" versions together on the same computer.

=== Installing on Linux ===

On most modern Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Debian, Mint, Elementary, etc), FreeCAD can be installed with the click of a button, directly from the software management application provided by your distribution (the aspect of it can differ from the images below, each distribution uses its own tool).

# Open the software manager and search for "freecad": <br>[[Image:Freecad-linux-install-01.jpg|800px]]
# Click the "install" button and that's it, FreeCAD gets installed. Don't forget to rate it afterwards! <br>[[Image:Freecad-linux-install-02.jpg|800px]]

'''Alternative ways'''

One of the big joys of using Linux is the multitude of possibilities to tailor your software, so don't restrain yourself. On Ubuntu and derivatives, FreeCAD can also be installed from a [https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers PPA] maintained by the FreeCAD community (it contains both stable and development versions).  On Fedora, recent development versions of FreeCAD can be installed from [https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/groups/g/freecad/coprs/ copr], and because this is open source software, you can also easily [[Compiling|compile FreeCAD yourself]].

=== Installing on  Mac OS ===

Installing FreeCAD on Mac OSX is nowadays as easy as on other platforms. However, since there are fewer people in the community who own a Mac, the available packages sometimes lag a few versions behind the other platforms.

# Download a zipped package corresponding to your version from  the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases download page].
# Open the Downloads folder, and expand the downloaded zip file: [[Image:Freecad-mac-01.jpg|none]]
# Drag the FreeCAD application from inside the zip to the Applications folder: [[Image:Freecad-mac-02.jpg|none]]
# That's it, FreeCAD is installed! [[Image:Freecad-mac-03.jpg|none]]
5. If the system prevents FreeCAD from launching due to restricted permissions for applications not coming from the App store, you will need to enable it in the system settings: [[Image:Freecad-mac-04.jpg|none]]

=== Uninstalling ===

Hopefully you won't want to uninstall FreeCAD, but it is good to know how. On Windows and Linux, uninstalling FreeCAD is very straightforward. On Windows, use the standard "remove software" option found in the control panel; on Linux, remove it with the same software manager you used to install it. On Mac OS, simply remove it from the Applications folder.

=== Setting basic preferences ===

Once FreeCAD is installed, you might want to open it and change some preferences. Preference settings in FreeCAD are located under menu '''Edit → Preferences'''. Listed below are some basic settings you may wish to change; you can browse through the preference pages to see if there is anything else you want to change.

# '''Language''': (''General'' category, ''General'' tab) FreeCAD will automatically pick the language of your operating system, but you might want to change that. FreeCAD is almost fully translated into five or six languages; others are currently only partially translated. You can easily [https://crowdin.com/project/freecad help translating FreeCAD]. [[Image:Freecad-basic-options01.jpg|none]]
# '''Auto-load module''': (''General'' category, ''General'' tab) Normally, FreeCAD will start by showing you the start page. You can skip this and begin a FreeCAD session directly in the workbench of your choice, listed under ''Startup'', ''Auto load module after startup''. [[Workbenches]] will be explained in detail in the [[Manual:The FreeCAD Interface|next chapter]].
# '''Create new document at startup''': (''General'' category, ''Document'' tab) Combined with the ''Auto-load module'' option above, if checked this starts FreeCAD ready for work. [[Image:Freecad-basic-options02.jpg|none]]
# '''Storage options''': (''General'' category, ''Document'' tab) As with any complex application, FreeCAD likely contains bugs causing it to crash occasionally. Here you can configure options to help you to recover your work in case of a crash.
# '''Authoring and license''': (''General'' category, ''Document'' tab) Here you set the values to be used for new files you create. Consider making your files shareable right from the start, by using a friendlier, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft copyleft] license like [https://creativecommons.org/ Creative Commons].
# '''Redirect internal python messages''': (''General'' category, ''Output window'' tab) These two options are always good to check, as they will cause messages from the internal python interpreter to show up in the [[Manual:The_FreeCAD_Interface#Report_view|Report View]] when there's a problem running a python script. [[Image:Freecad-basic-options03.jpg|none]]
# '''Units''': (''General'' category, ''Units'' tab) Here you can set the default units system you wish to use. [[Image:Freecad-basic-options04.jpg|none]]
# '''Zoom at cursor''': (''Display'' category, ''3D'' tab) If set, zoom operations will be focused at the mouse pointer.  If unset, the center of the current view is the zoom focus.
# '''Invert zoom''': (''Display'' category, ''3D'' tab) Inverts the direction of zooming relative to mouse movement. [[Image:FreeCAD-v0-18-Preferences-Display.png]]

=== Installing additional content ===

As the FreeCAD project and its community grows quickly, and also because it is easy to extend, external contributions and side-projects made by community members and other enthusiasts begin to appear everywhere on the internet. Most of these external projects are workbenches or macros, and can be easily installed right from within FreeCAD via the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] located under menu '''Tools'''. The addons manager will allow you to install many interesting components, for example:

# A [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library Parts library], which contains all kinds of useful models, or pieces of models, created by FreeCAD users that can be freely used in your projects. The library can be used and accessed right from inside your FreeCAD installation.
# [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons Additional workbenches], that extend the functionality of FreeCAD for certain tasks, for example animate parts of your models, or areas, such as sheet metal folding or BIM. Further explanations of each workbench and what tools it contains is given on each addon page, that you can visit by clicking the corresponding link on the addon manager.
# A [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros collection of macros], which are also available [[Macros recipes|on the FreeCAD wiki]] along with documentation about how to use them.

If you are using the Ubuntu operating system, some of the addons above are also available as packages on the [https://launchpad.net/freecad-extras FreeCAD addons PPA]
