== Introdução ==

In FreeCAD and in this documentation, an [[addon|addon]] is any component that is not part of the base installation, but that can be added to the system by certain methods.

== Different types ==

There are three types of addons:
* [[Macros|Macros]]: short snippet of [[Python|Python]] code that provides a new tool or functionality in a single file ending with {{incode|.FCMacro}}.
* [[External_workbenches|Workbenches]]: collections of Python files that provide related [[Gui_Command|Gui Commands]] (tools) centered around a particular topic, for example, tools to design cabinets, or tools to work with architecture, or tools to design boats, etc. These workbenches usually define new toolbars where [[Gui_Command|commands]] are placed as buttons.
* [[Preference_Packs|Preference Packs]]: distributable collections of user preferences. {{Version|0.20}}

== Installation ==

The recommended way to install addons is with the [[File:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]].

But for macros and workbenches manual installation is also possible:
* [[How_to_install_macros|How to install macros]]
* [[Installing_more_workbenches|Installing more workbenches]]

== Information for developers ==

If you have developed a macro or workbench, and want to see it included in the Addon manager, read how to do so on the repository pages: ([https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons/ FreeCAD-addons] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros/ FreeCAD-macros]). If you add your macro to the [[Macros_recipes|Macros recipes]] page, there is nothing else to do, it will automatically be picked up by the Addon manager.
