=Installation=

==Raytracing Workbench==

{{VeryImportantMessage|Officially the [[Raytracing_Workbench|Raytracing workbench]] does not work with LuxCoreRender, only with the outdated [[LuxRender|LuxRender]]. Also the [[Raytracing_Workbench|Raytracing workbench]] is being superseded by the new [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render Render Workbench], which is intended as its replacement. The Render Workbench can be installed through the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. The information here is provided because by default FreeCAD is still shipped (as of 0.19-24276) with the Raytracing Workbench}}
