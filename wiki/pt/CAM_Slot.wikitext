==Description== 

The [[Image:CAM_Slot.svg|24px]] [[CAM_Slot|Slot]] tool creates a simple slotting operation using various methods of input.

Inputs include:
* selecting one or more faces or edges.
* selecting two vertices.
* entering two custom points.

The CAM Slot object is made to be part of a [[Image:CAM_Job.svg|24px]] [[CAM_Job|CAM Job]].

==Usage==

# Select the reference geometry on the model:
#* one or more faces or edges.
#* two vertices.
#* ''' ''nothing'' ''' to use two custom points entered in the Property View of the Data tab: Custom Point1 and Custom Point2.
# Invoke the Slot command using several methods:
#* Pressing the {{KEY|[[Image:CAM_Slot.svg|24px]] [[CAM_Slot|Slot]]}} button in the toolbar. 
<!--#* Using the {{KEY|P}} then {{KEY|O}} keyboard shortcut.-->
#* Using the {{KEY| CAM}} →  {{KEY|[[Image:CAM_Slot.svg|24px]] [[CAM_Slot|Slot]]}} entry from the top menu.
# Adjust the desired properties. Descriptions of available properties are found below.

====Usage Notes====

* All slots:
** Both the beginning and end of a slot path can be extended or shortened. Use the `Extend Path Start` and `Extend Path End` properties.
** Use the `Layer Mode` property to cut the slot in `Single-pass` mode at final depth, or in `Multi-pass` mode using the available `Step Down` property.
** Toggle the `Reverse Direction` property to reverse the direction of the cut path.

* Linear slots:
** Currently there is no capability to offset linear slots laterally (parallel to path of travel). '' '''Example:''' '' Say you have a tool diameter smaller than the width of the slot area you are clearing. Current behavior of this operation is to create a set of paths on a plane down the center-line of the designated slot, which will result in the slot volume not being fully cleared. Some users would want the operation to create multiple paths that are offset laterally to clear the entire slot area; this not directly possible, though can be achieved through using "Custom Points", see "Vertical face milling" below. Alternatively use the Pocket operation for such clearing.
** Create a custom linear slot using the `Custom Point1` and `Custom Point2` properties with no geometry selection. '' '''Example:''' '' Initiate a Slot operation in the GUI and click `OK` to save. Now locate and edit the `Custom Point1` and `Custom Point2` properties in the Data tab of the newly created Slot operation. Recompute the operation to update the path.

* Vertical face milling:
** Most of the CAM tools cannot make a path on a single vertical plane since the projection onto horizontal plane has zero area (an internal limitation). The Slot operation makes this possible by selecting "Custom points" which define a line parallel to the vertical plane and suitable Depth parameters. 

* Arc/Circular slots:
**Creating arc/circular slots
**# You will need to select one bottom arc of the slot. This will produce a path directly on the arc edge you selected.
**# You will then need to edit the `Extend Radius` property in the Data tab of the operation.  Using the expression editor, set it to either `OpToolDiameter / 2.0` or the negative version `OpToolDiameter / -2.0` as needed, depending on whether you selected the inside or outside arc of the slot.
**# Recompute the operation.
**# Keep in mind that if the toolbit diameter is not equal to the slot width, the path will '''''not''''' be in the correct location. In this case, adjust the value in the `Extend Radius` property mentioned above.
** Currently users are unable to create a custom arc/circular path. A third `Custom Center` property will need to be added, along with additional modifications to the code base.

==Properties==

''' ''Note'' ''': Not all of these Properties are available in the Task Window Editor. Some are only accessible in the Data tab of the Properties View panel for this Operation.
