{{GuiCommand

|MenuLocation=Part → Primitives → Cube
|Workbenches=[[Part_Workbench|Part]]
|SeeAlso=[[Part_Primitives|Part Primitives]]
}}

== Description ==

The [[Image:Part_Box.svg|24px]] '''Part Box''' command creates a parametric box solid, a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid rectangular cuboid]. In the coordinate system defined by its {{PropertyData|Placement}} property, the bottom face of the box lies on the XY plane with its front left corner at the origin, and its front edge parallel to the X axis.

[[Image:Part_Box_Example.png|400px]]

== Usage ==

# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Box.svg|16px]] [[Part_Box|Cube]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → Primitives → [[Image:Part_Box.svg|16px]] Cube}} option from the menu.
# The box is created.
# Optionally change the dimensions and {{PropertyData|Placement}} of the box by doing one of the following:
#* Double-click the object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]:
#*# The {{MenuCommand|Geometric Primitives}} task panel opens.
#*# Change one or more properties.
#*# The object is dynamically updated in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
#*# Press the {{Button|OK}} button.
#* Change the properties in the [[Property_editor|Property editor]].
#* Change the {{PropertyData|Placement}} with the [[Image:Std_TransformManip.svg|16px]] [[Std_TransformManip|Std TransformManip]] command.

== Example ==

[[Image:Part_Box_Scripting_Example.png|thumb|Part Box from the scripting example]]

A Part Box object created with the [[#Scripting|scripting example]] below is shown here.

== Notes ==

* A Part Box can also be created with the [[Image:Part_Primitives.svg|16px]] [[Part_Primitives|Part Primitives]] command. With that command you can specify the dimensions and placement at creation time.

== Properties ==

See also: [[Property_editor|Property editor]].

A Part Box object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [[Part_Part2DObject#Data|Part Part2DObject]].

{{TitleProperty|Box}}

* {{PropertyData|Length|Length}}: The length of the box. This is the dimension in its X direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.
* {{PropertyData|Width|Length}}: The width of the box. This is the dimension in its Y direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.
* {{PropertyData|Height|Length}}: The height of the box. This is dimension in its Z direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

== Scripting ==

See also: [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ Autogenerated API documentation], [[Part_scripting|Part scripting]] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

A Part Box can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:

{{Code|code=
box = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box", "myBox")
}}

* Where {{Incode|"myBox"}} is the name for the object.
* The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

box = doc.addObject("Part::Box", "myBox")
box.Length = 4
box.Width = 8
box.Height = 12
box.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(75, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()
}}
