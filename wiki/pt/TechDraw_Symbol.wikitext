==Description==

The '''TechDraw Symbol''' tool inserts a Symbol object. A Symbol is a stripped down view that contains only a single [[SVG|SVG]] file complying with the svg-tiny specification (see [[TechDraw_Templates#Notes|TechDraw Templates]]). 

A Symbol can be anything that helps annotate a drawing and that doesn't need to be further modified, it may however contain  [[Svg_Namespace#freecad:editable|editable texts]].

{{Version|1.0}}: The [[TechDraw_View|TechDraw View]] tool can also create a Symbol.

==Usage==

# If there are multiple drawing pages in the document: optionally activate the desired page by selecting it in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# Select the {{MenuCommand|TechDraw → TechDraw Views → [[Image:TechDraw_Symbol.svg|16px]] Insert SVG Symbol}} option from the menu.
# If there are multiple drawing pages in the document and you have not yet activated a page, the '''Page Chooser''' dialog box opens:
## Select the desired page.
## Press the {{Button|OK}} button.
# A file browser opens.
# Select an SVG file.
# A symbol is inserted.
# Optionally change its {{PropertyData|Scale}} property to adjust its size.

== Notes ==

* {{PropertyData|Scale Type}} for Symbols is always set to ''Custom'' at creation. This is for convenience, since symbols are almost always scaled differently from the rest of the objects on the page.

A Symbol, formally a {{Incode|TechDraw::DrawViewSymbol}} object, has the [[TechDraw_View#Properties_Part_View|properties]] that are common to all View types. It also has the following additional properties:

* {{PropertyData|Symbol|String|Hidden}}: The SVG code defining this symbol.
* {{PropertyData|Editable Texts|StringList}}: Substitution values for the editable strings in this symbol.

The Symbol tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following functions:

{{Code|code=
sym = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject('TechDraw::DrawViewSymbol','TestSymbol')
rc = page.addView(anno)
f = open(unicode(symbolFileSpec,'utf-8'),'r')
svg = f.read()
f.close()
sym.Symbol = svg
rc = page.addView(sym)
}}
