In FreeCAD the word "[[Sketch|Sketch]]" is normally used to refer to a [[Sketcher_SketchObject|Sketcher SketchObject]] ({{incode|Sketcher::SketchObject}} class) that is defined by the [[Sketcher Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]]. This is a 2D drawing that uses mathematical constraints to describe 2D geometry precisely.

See [[Sketcher SketchObject|Sketcher SketchObject]] for more information about this type of object.

==Usage==

There are two common ways to create a Sketch: using the [[Sketcher Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]] directly, or through the [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].

=== Sketcher Workbench ===

# Switch to the [[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]].
# Press {{Button|[[File:Sketcher_NewSketch.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_NewSketch|Sketcher NewSketch]]}}.

=== PartDesign Workbench ===

# Switch to the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].
# Press {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Body.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]]}}.
# Press {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_NewSketch.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_NewSketch|PartDesign NewSketch]]}}.

After you finish editing the sketch, close it to go out of edit mode. Double click on it to enter edit mode again.

== Notes ==

A Sketch is very commonly used in conjunction with the [[File:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] to create solids by extrusion, using the {{Button|[[File:PartDesign Pad.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign Pad|PartDesign Pad]]}} operation.

Nevertheless, a Sketch can always be created by itself for any other purpose; it does not have to be tied to a [[PartDesign Body|PartDesign Body]]. For example, the {{Button|[[File:Arch_Window.svg|16px]] [[Arch_Window|Arch Window]]}} tool of the [[File:Workbench_BIM.svg|16px]] [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]] uses Sketches to define the shapes of windows and doors; in the same way, they can be used to define the shape of {{Button|[[File:Arch_Wall.svg|16px]] [[Arch_Wall|Arch Walls]]}}.
