== Description ==

The splash screen is an image that appears during the startup of FreeCAD. You can disable the splash screen in the [[Preferences_Editor#General_2|Preferences Editor]] by unchecking the option '''Enable splash screen at startup'''.

{{Version|1.0}}: The splash screen image is picked randomly from multiple images including user models and selected add-on workbenches.

== Custom splash screen ==

To use a custom splash screen, you have to place an image named {{FileName|splash_image.png}} in one of the following directories depending on the operating system:
* '''Linux:''' {{FileName|$XDG_DATA_HOME/FreeCAD/Gui/images/}} (normally this corresponds to {{FileName|~/.local/share/FreeCAD/Gui/images/}})
* '''Windows:''' {{FileName|%APPDATA%\FreeCAD\Gui\images\}} (normally {{FileName|C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\Gui\images\}})
* '''MacOS:''' {{FileName|~/Library/Application Support/FreeCAD/Gui/images/}}

The directory can be found using the {{Incode|App.getUserAppDataDir()}} command in the [[Python_console|Python console]]. The {{Incode|Gui}} and {{Incode|images}} folders may have to be created first. The same custom splash screen will be used for all versions of FreeCAD on a given computer.
