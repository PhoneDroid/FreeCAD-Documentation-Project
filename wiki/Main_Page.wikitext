== Introduction == <!--T:17-->

<!--T:1-->
This is the documentation wiki of [http://www.freecad.org FreeCAD]. There are several ways to use this documentation: by exploring the hubs, by following the manual, or by using the Help menu entries from within FreeCAD. This is a work in progress, written by the community of users and developers of FreeCAD. If you find information that is wrong or missing, please [[Special:MyLanguage/help_FreeCAD|help FreeCAD]]!

== The hubs == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
 [[Image:Crystal_Clear_app_display.png|64px|left]] [[User_hub|Users hub]]: This page contains documentation useful for FreeCAD users in general: a list of all the workbenches, detailed instructions on how to install and use the FreeCAD application, tutorials, and all you need to get started.

[[Image:Crystal Clear app terminal.png|64px|left]] [[Power_users_hub|Power users hub]]: This page gathers documentation for advanced users and people interested in writing Python scripts. There you will also find a repository of macros, instructions on how to install and use them, and more information about customizing FreeCAD to your specific needs.

[[Image:Crystal Clear app tutorials.png|64px|left]] [[Developer_hub|Developers hub]]: This section contains material for developers: How to compile FreeCAD yourself, how the FreeCAD source code is structured, how to navigate the source code, how to develop new workbenches, and embed FreeCAD in your own application.

== Manual == <!--T:5-->

 <!--T:14-->
[[Image:Crystal_Clear_manual.png|64px|left]] [[Manual:Introduction|The FreeCAD manual]]  is another, more linear way to present the information contained in this wiki. It is designed to be read like a book, and will gently introduce you to many other pages from the hubs above. [https://www.gitbook.com/book/yorikvanhavre/a-freecad-manual/details ebook versions] are also available, as well as [https://www.freecad.org/manual/ a couple of translations in pdf format].

=== How to participate === <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
There is plenty to do inside the FreeCAD project, if you are interested in helping us. Of course, there are programming tasks for C++ or Python programmers, but there are also many things you can do even if you cannot code, such as 
* writing documentation and [[WikiPages|editing the wiki (en)]] 
* helping newcomers
* translating the application and documentation
* helping with the packaging of the latest release of FreeCAD for your favourite operating system
* helping other people around you to discover FreeCAD. 

<!--T:16-->
The [[Special:MyLanguage/help_FreeCAD|help FreeCAD]] page describes it all with more details. Starting from 2016, FreeCAD also participates in the [[Google_Summer_of_Code|Google Summer of Code]].

=== Source code === <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
FreeCAD can be compiled on all platforms using [https://cmake.org/ CMake]. The source code is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License LGPL]-licensed and hosted on [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD GitHub] and mirrored on [https://gitlab.com/freecad/FreeCAD GitLab], [https://sourceforge.net/projects/free-cad/ SourceForge] and [https://codeberg.org/FreeCAD/FreeCAD CodeBerg]. There are build instructions for [[Compile_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Compile_on_Linux|Linux]] and [[Compile_on_MacOS|MacOS]]. The source code documentation is [http://www.freecad.org/api/ hosted here], generated by [[Doxygen|Doxygen]], and [[Source_documentation|documented on the wiki]].

=== About the development === <!--T:12-->
