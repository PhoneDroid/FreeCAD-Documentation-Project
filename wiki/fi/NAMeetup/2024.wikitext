Staffed hours at the venue are 9-5, but there is not a hard cutoff for daily events.

== Getting here ==

Innovate Springfield is a mere 5 minute walk from the Amtrak station, and there are several lodging & many food options within walking distance of the venue, so feel free to leave the car at home!

For long-distance travelers, the international airports in St. Louis and Chicago are both connected to the Amtrak network by regional rail and are a short 1 hour or moderate 3 hour ride to the Springfield station.

== Schedule ==

===== Thursday, Aug 15 =====

The first day of the meetup will be a hackathon!

===== Friday, Aug 16 =====

For Friday, we will schedule lightning talks and short & medium presentations, i.e. timeslots of no more than 5, 25, or 50 minutes. Please send proposals to spi24@freecad.org.

===== Saturday, Aug 17 =====

Showcase & Learning Day! On Saturday, an invitation will be made to the public for any who are interested in coming to see what can be done with FreeCAD, what can be made with it, how to use it, or how to work on it. Bring projects to show off and put on a welcoming face!

===== Sunday, Aug 18 =====

The final day of the meetup will also be an unstructured hackathon day, to allow for participants who might need to leave early, or to fit in some tourism time.
