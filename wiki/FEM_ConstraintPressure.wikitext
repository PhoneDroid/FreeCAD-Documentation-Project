==Description==

Applies a pressure load to a face.

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:FEM_ConstraintPressure.svg|16px]] [[FEM_ConstraintPressure|Pressure load]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Model → Mechanical boundary conditions and loads → [[Image:FEM_ConstraintPressure.svg|16px]] Pressure load}} option from the menu.
# Press the {{Button|Add}} button and select face(s) in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. Optionally press the {{Button|Remove}} and click on the faces that you want to remove from the selection.
# Edit the appropriate window to specify the pressure load in MPa.
# Tick the box to reverse the direction if necessary.

==Notes==

* Distribution of the pressure on a face is always uniform and always perpendicular to the face.

* {{VersionMinus|0.21}}: Pressure load can be applied to shells but only when [[FEM_MeshGmshFromShape|Gmsh]] is used for meshing and group meshing is set to true. It is hardcoded as true so the user doesn't have to worry about that. However, due to a bug, pressure load may require remeshing to work on shells.
* This feature uses the [https://web.mit.edu/calculix_v2.7/CalculiX/ccx_2.7/doc/ccx/node190.html *DLOAD card in CalculiX].
