[[Debian_Unstable|Debian Unstable]] is a good target distribution for FreeCAD development on Linux since it provides the most up-to-date packages possible, as a rolling distribution. One can contribute both to FreeCAD development on Debian as well as its ecosystem of related packages and dependencies.
