==Description== <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
The '''Arch Wall''' tool builds a Wall object from scratch or on top of any other [[Part_Workbench|shape]]-based or [[Mesh_Workbench|mesh]]-based object. A wall can be built without any base object, in which case it behaves as a cubic volume, using length, width and height properties. When built on top of an existing shape, a wall can be based on:

<!--T:4-->
* A '''linear 2D object''', such as lines, wires, arcs or sketches, in which case you can change thickness, alignment (right, left or centered) and height. The length property has no effect.
* A '''flat face''', in which case you can only change the height. Length and width properties have no effect. If the base face is vertical, however, the wall will use the width property instead of height, allowing you to build walls from space-like objects or mass studies.
* A '''solid''', in which case length, width and height properties have no effect. The wall simply uses the underlying solid as its shape.
* A '''mesh''', in which case the underlying mesh must be a closed, manifold solid.

<!--T:6-->
Walls can also have additions or subtractions. Additions are other objects whose shapes are joined in this Wall's shape, while subtractions are subtracted. Additions and subtractions can be added with the [[Arch Add|Arch Add]] and [[Arch Remove|Arch Remove]] tools. Additions and subtractions have no influence over wall parameters such as height and width, which can still be changed. Walls can also have their height automatic, if they are included into a higher-level object such as [[Arch Floor|floors]]. The height must be kept at 0, then the wall will adopt the height specified in the parent object.

<!--T:7-->
When several walls should intersect, you need to place them into a [[Arch Floor|floor]] to have their geometry intersected.

==Usage== <!--T:8-->

===Drawing a wall from scratch=== <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Arch_Wall.svg|16px]] [[Arch_Wall|Wall]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|3D/BIM → [[Image:Arch_Wall.svg|16px]] Wall}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|W}} then {{KEY|A}}.
# Click a first point on the 3D view, or type coordinates.
# Click a second point on the 3D view, or type coordinates.

===Drawing a wall on top of a selected object=== <!--T:11-->

<!--T:12-->
# Select one or more base geometry objects (Draft object, sketch, etc).
# Invoke the tool as described above.
# Adjust needed properties such as height or width.

==Options== <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
* Walls share the common properties and behaviours of all [[Arch Component|Arch Components]]
* The height, width and alignment of a wall can be set during drawing, via the task panel
* When snapping a wall to an existing wall, both walls will be joined into one. The way the two walls are joined depends on their properties: If they have the same width, height and alignment, and if the option "join base sketches" is enabled in the Arch preferences, the resulting wall will be one object based on a sketch made of several segments. Otherwise, the latter wall will be added to the first one as addition.
* Press {{KEY|X}}, {{KEY|Y}} or {{KEY|Z}} after the first point to constrain the second point on the given axis.
* To enter coordinates manually, simply enter the numbers, then press {{KEY|Enter}} between each X, Y and Z component.
* Press {{KEY|R}} or click the checkbox to check/uncheck the '''Relative''' button. If relative mode is on, the coordinates of the second point are relative to the first one. If not, they are absolute, taken from the (0,0,0) origin point.
* Press {{KEY|Shift}} while drawing to [[Draft_Constrain|constrain]] your second point horizontally or vertically in relation to the first one.
* Press {{KEY|Esc}} or the {{Button|Cancel}} button to abort the current command.
* Double-clicking on the wall in the tree view after it is created allows you to enter edit mode and access and modify its additions and subtractions
* Multi-layer walls can be easily created by building several walls from the same baseline. By setting their Align property to either left or right, and specifying an Offset value, you can effectively construct several wall layers. Placing a window in such a wall layer will propagate the opening to the other wall layers based on the same baseline.
* Walls can also make use of [[Arch MultiMaterial|Multi-Materials]]. When using a multi-material, the wall will become multi-layer, using the thicknesses specified by the multi-material. Any layer with a thickness of zero will have its thickness defined automatically by the remaining space defined by the Wall's Width value, after subtracting the other layers.
* Walls can be made to display blocks, instead of one single solid, by turning their {{PropertyData|Make Blocks}} property on. The size and offset of blocks can be configured with different properties, and the amount of blocks is automatically calculated.

==Snapping== <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
Snapping works a bit differently with Arch walls than other Arch and Draft objects. If a wall has a baseline object, snapping will anchor to the base object, instead of the wall geometry, allowing to easily align walls by their baseline. If, however, you specifically want to snap to the wall geometry, pressing {{KEY|Ctrl}} will switch snapping to the wall object.

==Properties== <!--T:17-->

<!--T:33-->
Wall objects inherit the properties of [[Part Workbench|Part]] objects, and also have the following extra properties:

===Data=== <!--T:34-->

<!--T:35-->
{{TitleProperty|Blocks}}

<!--T:25-->
* {{PropertyData|Block Height}}: The height of each block.
* {{PropertyData|Block Length}}: The length of each block.
* {{PropertyData|Count Broken}}: The number of broken blocks (read-only).
* {{PropertyData|Count Entire}}: The number of entire blocks (read-only).
* {{PropertyData|Joint}}: The size of the joints, the empty space, between blocks.
* {{PropertyData|Make Blocks}}: Enables block generation.
* {{PropertyData|Offset First}}: The horizontal offset of the first and every uneven line of blocks.
* {{PropertyData|Offset Second}}: The horizontal offset of the second and every even line of blocks.

<!--T:36-->
{{TitleProperty|Component}}

<!--T:39-->
See [[Arch_Component#Properties|Arch Component]].

<!--T:40-->
{{TitleProperty|IFC}}

<!--T:41-->
See [[Arch_Component#Properties|Arch Component]].

<!--T:42-->
{{TitleProperty|IFC Attributes}}

<!--T:43-->
See [[Arch_Component#Properties|Arch Component]].

<!--T:38-->
{{TitleProperty|Wall}}

<!--T:18-->
* {{PropertyData|Align}}: The alignment of the wall on its baseline: Left, Right or Center. The direction of the individual edges of the Base object (Sketch/ArchSketch) is taken into account, giving finer control over each wall segment. See diagram below. Arcs in sketches are always counter-clockwise. When a curved segment of a wall is left aligned, the inner edge of the segment matches the sketch arc. See also '''Override Align'''.
* {{PropertyData|Area}}: Area of the whole wall, separation into blocks makes no difference (read-only).
* {{PropertyData|Face}}: The index of the face from the base object to use. If the value is not set or 0, the whole object is used.
* {{PropertyData|Height}}: The height of the wall. Ignored if the wall is based on a solid. If set to zero, and the wall is inside a [[Arch_Floor|floor]] object with its height defined, the wall will automatically take the value of the floor height.
* {{PropertyData|Length}}: The length of the wall. The value can be edited if the wall is based on an unconstrained sketch with a single edge, or on a [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]] with a single edge, else the value is read-only. {{Version|1.0}} The value when the property is read-only is more accurate. It is based on the medium of the wall if segments have different {{PropertyData|Width}}, {{PropertyData|Align}} and/or {{PropertyData|Offset}} properties. Note that there can still be inaccuracies if the wall is complex, for example if it has T-junctions or self-intersections. In such cases it is advisable to instead use the {{PropertyData|Horizontal Area}} property for further calculations.
* {{PropertyData|Normal}}: The extrusion direction for the wall. If set to (0,0,0), the extrusion direction is automatic.
* {{PropertyData|Offset}}: The distance between the wall and its baseline. Works only if the '''Align''' property is set to Right or Left. The direction of the individual edges of the Base object (Sketch/ArchSketch) is taken into account, giving finer control over each wall segment. See also '''Override Offset'''.
* {{PropertyData|Override Align}}: This overrides '''Align''' attribute to set align of each segment of wall. Ignored if Base object provides Aligns information, with getAligns() method (If a value is not 'Left, Right, Center', the value of 'Align' will be followed). ENHANCEMENT by ArchSketch: GUI 'Edit Wall Segment Align' Tool is provided in the external [[File:SketchArch_Workbench.svg|16px]] [https://github.com/paullee0/FreeCAD_SketchArch SketchArch Add-on] to let users to set the values interactively. 'Toponaming-Tolerant' if ArchSketch is used in Base (and SketchArch Add-on is installed). Warning: Not 'Toponaming-Tolerant' if just Sketch is used.
* {{PropertyData|Override Width}}: This overrides '''Width''' attribute to set width of each segment of wall. Ignored if Base object provides Widths information, with getWidths() method (if a value is zero, the value of 'Width' will be followed). ENHANCEMENT by ArchSketch: GUI 'Edit Wall Segment Width' Tool is provided in the external [[File:SketchArch_Workbench.svg|16px]] [https://github.com/paullee0/FreeCAD_SketchArch SketchArch Add-on] to let users to set the values interactively. 'Toponaming-Tolerant' if ArchSketch is used in Base (and SketchArch Add-on is installed). Warning: Not 'Toponaming-Tolerant' if just Sketch is used.
* {{PropertyData|Override Offset}}: ({{Version|1.0}}) This overrides '''Offset''' attribute to set offset of each segment of wall. Ignored if Base object provides Offsets information, with getOffsets() method (If a value is zero, the value of 'Offset' will be followed). ENHANCEMENT by ArchSketch: GUI 'Edit Wall Segment Offset' Tool is provided in the external [[File:SketchArch_Workbench.svg|16px]] [https://github.com/paullee0/FreeCAD_SketchArch SketchArch Add-on] to let users to select the edges interactively. 'Toponaming-Tolerant' if ArchSketch is used in Base (and SketchArch Add-on is installed). Warning: Not 'Toponaming-Tolerant' if just Sketch is used. Property is ignored if Base ArchSketch provided the selected edges.
* {{PropertyData|Width}}: The width of the wall. Ignored if the wall is based on a face or a solid. See also '''Override Width'''.

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[Arch_API|Arch API]] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

<!--T:20-->
The Wall tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:

</translate>
{{Code|code=
Wall = makeWall(baseobj=None, length=None, width=None, height=None, align="Center", face=None, name="Wall")
}}
<translate>

<!--T:21-->
* Creates a {{incode|Wall}} object from the given {{incode|baseobj}}, which can be a [[Draft Workbench|Draft object]], a [[Sketcher Workbench|Sketch]], a face, or a solid.
** If no {{incode|baseobj}} is given, you can provide the numerical values for the {{incode|length}}, {{incode|width}} (thickness), and {{incode|height}}.
** If given, {{incode|face}} can be used to give the index of a face from the underlying object, to build this wall on, instead of using the whole object.
* {{incode|align}} can be {{incode|"Center"}}, {{incode|"Left"}} or {{incode|"Right"}}.
* It returns {{incode|None}} if the operation fails.

<!--T:22-->
Example:

</translate>
{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD, Draft, Arch

p1 = FreeCAD.Vector(0, 0, 0)
p2 = FreeCAD.Vector(2000, 0, 0)
baseline = Draft.makeLine(p1, p2)
Wall1 = Arch.makeWall(baseline, length=None, width=150, height=2000)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()

Wall2 = Arch.makeWall(None, length=2000, width=200, height=1000)
Draft.move(Wall2, FreeCAD.Vector(0, -1000, 0))
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()
