==Description==

The tool [[Image:CAM_Post.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Post|Post]] exports the selected [[Image:CAM_Job.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Job|CAM Job]] to a G-code file.

'''Each CNC Controller speaks a specific G-code dialect, requiring a Dialect-correct Postprocessor to translate the final output from the agnostic internal FreeCAD G-code dialect.'''

=== Typical functions of the Postprocessor include ===

*Using a correct Job output G-code file extension. 
*Selecting the G-code commands. CNC controllers typically support a subset of available G-code commands. The super-set of G-code commands contains powerful and specialized commands that otherwise must be processed using multiple simpler commands. Postprocessors are written to select the best G-code for an Operation, available on the target.   
*Formatting the G-code syntax by reordering the Feed, X, Y, Z, A, and B inputs, and the precision.
*Inserting a Pre-amble to set units, units format, Work plane, coordinate system, etc...
*Inserting a Post-amble to park the machine, stop it, process any arguments.  
*Inserting Tool changes, or suppressing them between subsequent operations using the same tool.
*Formatting the Feed and Speed rate information to revolutions per minute, or per second.
*Formatting Function Call Naming and Calling.

=== Postprocessor Customization ===

If you want to write your own postprocessor, have a look at the [[CAM_Postprocessor_Customization|CAM Postprocessor Customization]] page.

'''Note:''' Several provided Postprocessors generate suitable code for many CNC controllers, or can be used as templates for modification

Postprocessors contain configuration flags and are designed to be tuned by adding G-codes and M-codes to provided definitions for:
*Machine initialization
*Job finalization
*Tool-Changes
*Cooling on /off
*Etc...

Postprocessors use [[CAM_scripting#The_FreeCAD_Internal_G-code_Format|FreeCAD's internal G-code dialect]] in conjunction with the Postprocessor configuration definitions, to generate Dialect-Correct G-code for target machines. This allows the CAM workbench to generate correct G-code to target various CNC machine controllers by invoking different Postprocessors.

CNC Machine Controller types include:
*CNC mills
*CNC lathes
*3D Printers
*DragKnife Cutters
*Laser Cutters
*Engravers
*Plasma Torch Cutters
*Wire Benders
*EDM Cutters
*Etc...

If only one CNC machine is used, or if all CNC machines share a common Postprocesor, the CAM workbench would need to include only a single Postprocessor. If a single Postprocessor is inadequate to output G-code for all target CNC controllers, then multiple Postprocessors must be installed.

==Usage==

# Select a [[Image:CAM_Job.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Job|CAM Job]] in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:CAM_Post.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Post|CAM Post]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|CAM → [[Image:CAM_Post.svg|16px]] Post Process}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|P}} then {{KEY|P}}.
# Confirm the {{MenuCommand|Output File}} name and directory

==Options==

Output file and Postprocessor properties can be set in the  [[CAM_Job|Job]], at any time, prior to invoking the Postprocessor.

The provided Postprocessors are written with comments indicating areas containing Flags, Configuration Variables, and Sections of G-Codes and M-Codes that are to be used by the Postprocessor to configure the output.

Typical Configuration True/False Flags include:
*'''OUTPUT_COMMENTS''' (True = Allow, False = Suppress): Used to insert Text Comments in the output G-code file.
*'''OUTPUT_HEADER''' (True = Allow, False = Suppress): Used to insert Text Headers in the output G-code file.
*'''OUTPUT_LINE_NUMBERS''' (True = Allow, False = Suppress): Used to insert Line Numbers in the output G-code file.
*'''SHOW_EDITOR''' (True = Allow, False = Suppress): Used to show the output G-code in a Pop-up window when invoking the Postprocessor.
*'''MODAL''' (True = Allow, False = Suppress): Used to reduce the number of output G-code lines by stripping Mode information when the Mode is not changing.

Typical Configuration Variables include:
*'''LINENR''' (Line Number): Used to Set the Line Number index.
*'''UNITS''' (G20 or G21): Used to explicitly communicate to the target CNC controller what Units to use to interpret the final output file.
*'''MACHINE_NAME''' (Name of Target CNC Mill): Used to Insert a machine name label in the final output file.
*'''PRECISION''': Used to Set the number of digits to include after the decimal place in final output file

Typical Configuration Sections include:
*'''PREAMBLE''': Code configuration inserted at beginning of the Job.
*'''POSTAMBLE''': Code configuration appended to the Job, providing for parking the machine, etc...
*'''TOOL_CHANGE''': Code inserted with each tool change in the Job.

The {{KEY|Edit}} → {{KEY|Preferences...}} → {{KEY|CAM}} → {{KEY|Job Preferences tab}} → {{KEY|Defaults}} → {{KEY|CAM}} is used to set the default Postprocessor selected on Job creation. This allows CAM workbench to be configured to only display desired Postprocessors, and to set a default. 

Included Postprocessors are saved in '''FreeCAD/Mod/CAM/CAM/Post/scripts''' by default:
*centroid
*comparams
*dxf
*dynapath
*grbl, including support for bCNC header blocks using Job output argument --bcnc
*jtech (laser)
*[http://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode/g-code.html#gcode:g17-g19.1 linuxcnc] 
*mach3_mach4
*nccad
*opensbp
*phillips
*refactored* (These postprocessors are works-in-progress and will be changing a lot)
*rml
*smoothie
*uccnc

== Ограничения ==

* Do '''not''' use the {{KEY|File}} → {{KEY|Export}} menu for export to G-code, it will produce damaged G-code!
