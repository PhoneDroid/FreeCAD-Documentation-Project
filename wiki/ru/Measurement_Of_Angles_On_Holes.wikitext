This tutorial explains how to create center hole lines using the [[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px|link=TechDraw_Workbench]] [[TechDraw Workbench]] with oriented holes.

By creating angles for holes it's not possible to use vertical or horizontal center lines (false/true) from the properties of the view. Helping lines and/or helping points are created for this necessity.

== Proceeding ==

1. Setting center lines on holes:

There are some possibilities to create a center line for holes. 
At first the lines or points on the hole must be selected as shown below. Second, the following tools can be used from the toolbar to create the center line:

In the associated Combo View dialog box select in the Tasks panel under ''Orientation'' "Aligned" for axes out of main axes. ''Extend By'' means the length of the center line beyond of the body line in the drawing. With ''Shift Horizontal'' and ''Shift Vertical'' the center line can move in horizontal or vertical direction, if is necessary. ''Style'' means the figure of center line.
