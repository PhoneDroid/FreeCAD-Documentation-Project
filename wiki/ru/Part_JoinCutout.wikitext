<span id="Description"></span>
==Описание==

The [[Image:Part_JoinCutout.svg|24px]] '''Part JoinCutout''' tool creates a cutout in a walled object (e.g. a pipe) to fit another walled object.

[[image:JoinFeatures_Cutout.png|600px]]

<span id="Usage"></span>
==Применение== 

# Select the base object first, then the object to define the cutout. The order of selection is important. It is enough to select one sub-shape of each object (e.g. faces).
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_JoinCutout.svg|16px]] [[Part_JoinCutout|Cutout for object]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → Join → [[Image:Part_JoinCutout.svg|16px]] Cutout for object}} option from the menu.
# A Part JoinFeature object is created, with Mode set to 'Cutout'. Original objects are hidden, and the result of cutting is shown in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

<span id="Properties"></span>
==Свойства== 

{{TitleProperty|Основные}}

* {{PropertyData|Base}}: Reference to base object (the one to make the cutout in). The object should be a single solid.
* {{PropertyData|Tool}}: Reference to tool object (the object that is to fit into the cutout). The object can be a single solid, or a [[Part_Compound|valid compound]] of solids.
* {{PropertyData|Mode}}: The mode of operation, equals 'Cutout' (Changing that will transform the tool into another Part_JoinXXX). The value of 'bypass' can be used to temporarily disable the long computations (a compound of Base and Tool will be created, which is a fast operation).
* {{PropertyData|Refine}}: Sets whether to apply [[Part_RefineShape|Refine]] operation or not, to the final shape. The default value is determined by a 'Automatically refine shape after boolean operation' checkbox in PartDesign preferences. When Mode property is 'bypass', Refine is ignored (never applied).

<span id="Example"></span>
==Пример== 

# Create a pipe by applying [[Part_Thickness|thickness]] to a [[Part_Cylinder|cylinder]]: <br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step1.png|320px]]
# Create another, smaller diameter pipe, and [[Placement|place]] it so that it pierces the wall of the first pipe: <br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step2.png|320px]]
# Select the first pipe, then the second pipe (order of selection is important), and click the 'Cutout for object' option from the Join tools dropdown toolbar button. <br />[[image:JoinFeatures_Example_step3_Cutout.png|320px]]

<span id="Algorithm"></span>
==Алгоритм== 

The algorithms behind Join tools are quite simple, and understanding them is important to use the tools correctly.

1. Base object is [[Part_Cut|boolean-cut]] with Tool object. The resulting shape is a set ([[Part_Compound|compound]]) of non-intersecting solids (typically, two). 

2. The resulting compound is filtered: only the largest solid is kept.

3. If Refine property is true, the resulting shape is [[Part_RefineShape|refined]].

<span id="Notes"></span>
===Примечания=== 

* If after step 1, the object remains in one piece, the result of Cutout will be equivalent to [[Part_Cut|boolean cut]] of Base with Tool.
* Now, the tool will produce unexpected result, if a compound is supplied as Base. This may be changed in the future.
* Because the largest piece is determined by comparing volumes of pieces, the tool can only work with solids. This may be changed in the future.

<span id="Scripting"></span>
==Программирование==

The Join tools can by used in [[macros]] and from the python console by using the following function:

{{Code|code=JoinFeatures.makePartJoinFeature(name = 'Cutout', mode = 'Cutout')}}
* Creates an empty Cutout feature (or other Join feature, depending on mode passed). The properties Base and Tool must be assigned explicitly, afterwards.
* Returns the newly created object.

Пример:
{{code|code=
import JoinFeatures
j = JoinFeatures.makePartJoinFeature(name = 'Cutout', mode = 'Cutout' )
j.Base = FreeCADGui.Selection.getSelection()[0]
j.Tool = FreeCADGui.Selection.getSelection()[1]
}}

The tool itself is implemented in Python, see {{FileName|/Mod/Part/JoinFeatures.py}} ([https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Part/JoinFeatures.py Github link]) under where FreeCAD is installed.
