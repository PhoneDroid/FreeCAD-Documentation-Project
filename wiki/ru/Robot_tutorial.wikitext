==Setting up a trajectory==
#Switch to the [[Image:Workbench_Robot.svg|24px]] [[Robot Workbench]]
#Activate the model-tab in the [[tree view]] by clicking on it
#Create a new trajectory by clicking on the [[Image:Robot_CreateTrajectory.svg|24px]] [[Robot CreateTrajectory]] button
#Select the robot in the [[tree view]]
#Set home position for robot by clicking on [[Image:Robot_SetHomePos.svg|24px]] [[Robot SetHomePos|Robot_SetHomePos]]
#Switch to the [[Task Panel]]
#By using the sliders change robot position
#When robot and trajectory are selected in [[tree view]] clicking on [[Image:Robot_InsertWaypoint.svg|24px]] [[Robot InsertWaypoint|Robot InsertWaypoint]] will insert the way-point in the trajectory
#Each way-point is shown with a yellow cross, the waypoints are connected with orange lines
#Define at least three different way points and insert them in the trajectory

==Simulating robot movement==
#Select robot and trajectory in [[tree view]]
#Select simulation by clicking on [[Image:Robot_Simulate.svg|24px]] [[Robot Simulate|Robot Simulate]]
#Click on Play {{KEY| &#9654;}} button
