Modern Debian development workflows involve [https://wiki.debian.org/PackagingWithGit packaging with Git] and the primary tool for doing that is [http://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.html git-buildpackage]. git-buildpackage provides a <code>gbp</code> command with several options similar to the <code>git</code> command itself. Many of these commands are themselves just a wrapper of lower-level Debian tools, so the complexity to learning packaging can be quite high.

To get around that, here are the short & simple steps to getting started with git-buildpackage. This should work on nearly any Debian-based distribution, but I recommend working on this in a clean and separate environment a [[Debian_Unstable|Debian Unstable]] virtual machine.

# Install it with <code>sudo apt install git-buildpackage</code>
# Grab the dotfiles at the end of this page. You'll need: <code>~/.gbp.conf</code>, <code>~/.pbuilderrc</code>, and <code>~/.quiltrc</code>
# The package build will occur in a clean environment. Create it with <code>sudo git-pbuilder create</code>
# Find the URL of a package you want to build on https://salsa.debian.org, the Debian project's self-hosted GitLab instance
# Create a clone of it with <code>gbp clone --all <URL></code>
# Enter the cloned repo's directory with <code>cd</code>
# Run the build with <code>gbp buildpackage -us -uc</code>
# When it's finished, your packages will be at <code>../build-area/</code>.
