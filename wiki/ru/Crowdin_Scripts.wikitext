<span id="Managing_Translations_for_FreeCAD"></span>
== Управление переводами для FreeCAD ==

FreeCAD uses a 3rd party translation service called [https://crowdin.com/project/freecad Crowdin] to manage translations. 

There are 3 scripts in <code>FreeCAD/src/Tools</code> that are used to manage translation files:
# <code>updatets.py</code> [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Tools/updatets.py (github source)]
# <code>updatecrowdin.py</code> [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Tools/updatecrowdin.py (github source)]
# <code>updatefromcrowdin.py</code> [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Tools/updatefromcrowdin.py (github source)]

=== Примечания ===

* These scripts are run from the root of the <code>FreeCAD/</code> directory. 
* In order for these scripts to work one needs to have the valid FreeCAD Crowdin API key placed in their <code>~/.crowdin-freecad</code> file. (For security reasons, only available to people with admin rights on the crowdin FreeCAD project)
* Currently these tools are Python2 compatible.
 
=== updatets.py ===

The <code>updatets.py</code> script will create the .ts files in your local <code>FreeCAD/</code> directory. It generates .ts files (Qt Translation Source File). 

It is invoked with:
<code>python2 updatets.py</code>

=== updatecrowdin.py ===

The <code>updatecrowdin.py</code> script pushes changes to Crowdin (3rd party translation crowdsource translation service) from your local <code>FreeCAD/</code> directory. The script currently supports 4 arguments:

* <code>updatecrowdin.py status</code> prints a status of the translations
* <code>updatecrowdin.py update</code> updates crowdin the current version of .ts files found in the source code
* <code>updatecrowdin.py build</code> builds a new downloadable package on crowdin with all translated strings
* <code>updatecrowdin.py download</code> downloads the latest build

=== updatefromcrowdin.py ===

The <code>updatefromcrowdin.py</code> script pulls changes from crowdin to your local <code>FreeCAD/</code> directory.

== To send latest strings to crowdin ==

* Only tested on linux
* You need a .credentials file in your /home/YourUser directory. That file is a simple text file containing only one line, which is the API key that you get on https://crowdin.com/project/freecad/settings#api (only for admins)
* Make sure your repository is clean (git pull, git stash if needed)
* cd /path/to/freecad-source-code/src/Tools
* python updatets.py (will fill all the .ts files found in the source with the lastest strings)
* python updatecrowdin.py update (will send the ts files to crowdin. Crowdin will only update strings that are new)
* cd ../.. (go back to the source code root folder)
* git checkout . (undo all the changes to the .ts files, no reason to commit them right now as they are still untranslated)

== To merge latest translations from crowdin ==

* Only tested on linux
* You need a .credentials file in your /home/YourUser directory. That file is a simple text file containing only one line, which is the API key that you get on https://crowdin.com/project/freecad/settings#api (only for admins)
* Make sure your repository is clean (git pull, git stash if needed)
* cd /path/to/freecad-source-code/src/Tools
* python updatecrowdin.py build (will create a zip on crowdin side with all the files, can take a while.. This step can also be done on the crowdin website)
* python updatecrowdin.py download (will download a freecad.zip file in this directory)
* mv freecad.zip ~ move the zip file to your home dir, to avoid accidentally committing it later)
* (optional) edit updatefromcrowdin.py script and check that the default_languages contain all the ones you want (basically all that are at more than 50%)
* python updatefromcrowdin.py -z /home/YourUser/freecad.zip
* cd ../.. (go back to the source code root folder)
* if something went wrong  or you are unsure, clean everything with git checkout .
* if everything looks ok (git status), commit with git add . && git commit
* Create a PR on FreeCAD

== To generate a translation file from the website ==

* Clone the homepage repository
* cd /path/to/FreeCAD-homepage
* xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 -o lang/homepage.pot *.php
* Update the "homepage.po" on crowdin website manually, using the lang/homepage.pot file

== To update the translations of the website ==

* Get the freecad.zip file either by downloading it from the crowdin website or following instructions above (python updatecrowdin.py download)
* cd /path/to/FreeCAD-homepage
* Make sure your repository is clean (git pull, git stash if needed)
* python updatefromcrowdin.py -z /path/to/freecad.zip
* if something went wrong  or you are unsure, clean everything with git checkout .
* if everything looks ok (git status), commit with git add . && git commit
* Create a PR on FreeCAD-Homepage
* After the PR is merged, one of the admins will ftp push to the webhost
