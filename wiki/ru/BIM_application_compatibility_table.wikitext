This page gives a general overview of how the different tools and concepts found in other mainstream BIM applications compare to FreeCAD, specifically its [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]].

'''TODO:''' Add other BIM apps: [https://bonsaibim.org/ Bonsai], Allplan, Tekla, Vectorworks, BricsCAD, what else?

| '''Pricing and license''' 

|| Free for anyone to use, no registration necessary 
|| Free to use for students upon registration, registration and fee needed for other users 
|| Registration and fee

|-

| '''Default file format and versions''' 

|| The default FreeCAD files uses the '''.FCStd''' extension. Openable by FreeCAD and Blender (using a plugin). They can also be [[File_Format_FCStd|unzipped]]. Any FreeCAD file, created will any version, will open in any other version, newer or older. However, some complex objects created with a more recent version might not be editable anymore when opened in older versions. 
|| The default Revit files use the '''.rvt''' extension. Only openable by Revit. Files created with any older version will open. Files created with a newer version will not. 
|| The default ArchiCAD files use the '''.pln''' extension. Only openable by ArchiCAD. Files created with any older version will open. Files created with a newer version will not.

| '''Setting up project units'''

|| In FreeCAD, all models accept any unit. The unit you prefer to work with can be set in in menu '''Edit -> Preferences -> General -> Units'''. Changing the unit doesn't affect the model.
|| Select the right template (Metric or Imperial), then modify the unit aspect in menu '''Manage -> Project'''. Changing the unit doesn't affect the model.
|| Select the right template, then set the unit in menu '''Options -> Project Preferences -> Working units'''. Changing the unit affects the model.

|-

| '''Organizing the elements of your project''' 

|| You can use [[Arch_Site|sites]], [[Arch_Building|buildings]] and [[Arch_BuildingPart|building parts]] (storeys/levels), or standard [[Std_Group|groups]] to group and organize objects, and other FreeCAD workbenches offer additional grouping options. Building Parts can be made active by double-clicking them, which automatically adds next objects to them.
|| Objects are automatically organized into Floor Plans. You can further group objects into Groups.
|| Object are automatically organized into Floor Plans. You can further group objects into Groups and Layers.

|-

| '''Families of objects''' 

|| There is no concept of family in FreeCAD. The same idea is achieved by [[Draft Clone|cloning]] another object, in which case it adopts its shape and all its properties, or by constructing another similar object such as a [[Arch Wall|wall]] or [[Arch Structure|structure (column, beam)]] on the same base profile, in which case the profile is common but all the other properties (height, etc) are independent. Wall compositions depend on the [[Arch MultiMaterial|multimaterial]] used, which can also be shared by several wall instances. 
|| Each object belongs to a given family.
|| Each object belongs to a given type.

|-

| '''Grouping objects into reusable components''' 

|| FreeCAD groups cannot be instantiated (independent copies), but objects grouped into [[Part Compound|compounds]] or [[Arch BuildingPart|building parts]] can be cloned (dependent copies) or copied (independent copies).
|| Revit groups can be instantiated (dependent copies).
|| ArchiCAD groups cannot be instantiated (independent copies).

|-

| '''Standard BIM elements'''

|| Walls, structures (beams, columns and slabs), windows (doors and windows), roofs, stairs, frames (railings), equipment (furniture, appliances, etc)
|| Walls, beams, columns, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, roofs, stairs, railings, components (furniture, appliances, etc)
|| Walls, beams, columns, slabs, windows, doors, roofs, stairs, railings, curtain walls, objects (furniture, appliances, etc)
