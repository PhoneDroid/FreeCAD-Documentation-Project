== Описание == 

The [[Image:PartDesign_Draft.svg|24px]] '''PartDesign Draft''' tool creates angular draft on the selected faces of an object. It adds a '''Draft''' object to the document with its corresponding representation in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].

<span id="Usage"></span>
== Применение ==

=== Add a draft ===

# Optionally [[PartDesign_Body#Active_status|activate]] the Body to apply the Draft to.
# Select one or more faces of the Body.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:PartDesign_Draft.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Draft|Draft]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part Design → Apply a dress-up feature → [[Image:PartDesign_Draft.svg|16px]] Draft}} option from the menu.
# If there is no active Body, and there are two or more Bodies in the document, the {{MenuCommand|Active Body Required}} dialog will open and prompt you to activate one. If there is a single Body it will be activated automatically.
# The {{MenuCommand|Draft parameters}} [[Task_panel|task panel]] opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button to finish.


:''Remember'':
:* Since there must be at least one face for the feature, the last remaining face in the list cannot be removed.

=== Edit a draft ===

# Do one of the following:
#* Double-click the Draft object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
#* Right-click the Draft object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] and select {{MenuCommand|Edit Draft}} from the context menu.
# The {{MenuCommand|Draft parameters}} [[Task_panel|task panel]] opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button to finish.

== Опции ==

* {{MenuCommand|Add face}}: Add faces to the selection by pressing the {{Button|Add face}} button and selecting more faces. 
* {{MenuCommand|Remove face}}: Choose a way to remove faces from the selection:
** Select one or more faces in the list and press the {{KEY|Del}} key or right-click the list and select {{MenuCommand|Remove}} from the context menu.
** Press the {{Button|Remove face}} button. All previously selected faces are highlighted in purple. Select each face to be removed.
* {{MenuCommand|Draft angle}}: Set the Draft angle either by entering a value or by clicking the up/down arrows.
* {{MenuCommand|Neutral plane}}: Set the the neutral plane by pressing the {{Button|Neutral plane}} button and selecting the plane that must not change dimensionally.
* {{MenuCommand|Pull direction}}: Set the the pull direction by pressing the {{Button|Pull direction}} button, then select an edge. Pull Direction is only effective if the Neutral Plane has been set. Results can be unpredictable.
* {{MenuCommand|Reverse pull direction}}: Invert the pull direction by checking the {{MenuCommand|Reverse pull direction}} checkbox. This will toggle the draft between positive and negative angles.

<span id="Notes"></span>
== Примечания ==

* The Draft tool will only work on faces that are not tangentially connected to other faces. A common mistake is to attempt to apply draft to a face that already has a fillet applied to it. To solve this, remove the fillet, apply the draft as needed, then re-apply the fillet.
* As explained in the [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/class_b_rep_offset_a_p_i___draft_angle.html#a6d05c12ae272a4dc91f244dc0aaa63d7 OCC documentation], a face selected for Draft is tapered by inclining it through the specified Draft angle about the line of intersection between the Neutral plane and the selected face. Pull direction indicates the side of the Neutral plane from which material is removed if Draft angle is positive or added if Draft angle is negative. This also implies that Pull direction should be perpendicular to the Neutral plane and has analogous role to the Reverse pull direction checkbox.

A PartDesign Draft object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

===Data===

{{Properties_Title|Base}}

* {{PropertyData|Angle|Angle}}: Cannot be negative. Default: {{value|1.5 °}}.
* {{PropertyData|Reversed|Bool}}: Default: {{FALSE}}.
* {{PropertyData|Base|LinkSub}}: Sub-link to the parent feature's list of selected edges and faces.
* {{PropertyData|Support Transform|Bool}}: Include the base additive/subtractive shape when used in pattern features. If disabled, only the dressed part of the shape is used for patterning. Default: {{FALSE}}.
* {{PropertyData|Add Sub Shape|PartShape|hidden}}
* {{PropertyData|Base Feature|Link|hidden}}: Link to the parent feature.
* {{PropertyData|_ Body|LinkHidden|hidden}}: Link to the parent body.

{{Properties_Title|Draft}}

* {{PropertyData|Neutral Plane|LinkSub}}: Sub-link to the parent feature's list containing the neutral plane.
* {{PropertyData|Pull Direction|LinkSub}}

{{Properties_Title|Part Design}}

* {{PropertyData|Refine|Bool}}: Refine shape (clean up redundant edges) after adding/subtracting. The default value is determined by the {{MenuCommand|Automatically refine model after sketch-based operation}} preference. See [[PartDesign_Preferences#General|PartDesign Preferences]].
