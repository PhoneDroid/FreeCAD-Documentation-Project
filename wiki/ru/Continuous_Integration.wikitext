== Continuous Integration ==

Currently the FreeCAD repository on GitHub will trigger a build on several CI systems. Between these systems pretty much all the main OSs are coveredː Linux, macOS, and Windows. CIs can also be used to run [[Testing|unit tests]].

== Tips ==

* If you add {{Incode|[skip ci]}} or {{Incode|[ci skip]}} to a git commit it will cancel a CI build.

== Relevant links ==

* Forum post announcing new CIs: [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=657956 New CI is yours :)]
