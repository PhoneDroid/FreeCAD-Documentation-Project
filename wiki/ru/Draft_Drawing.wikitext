==Описание==

The [[Image:Draft_Drawing.svg|24px]] '''Draft Drawing''' command inserts views of selected objects into a [[Drawing_Workbench|drawing]] page.

This command is similar to the [[Drawing_View|Drawing View]] command but is optimized for [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] objects. Contrary to that command, it can handle specific objects such as [[Draft_Dimension|Draft Dimensions]] and [[Draft_Text|Draft Texts]], and it can render faces.

This command is now obsolete. Use the [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]] and the [[TechDraw_DraftView|TechDraw DraftView]] command instead.

# To use this command in FreeCAD version 0.19 and later you need to add a button to a custom toolbar. See [[Interface_Customization|Interface Customization]].
# Select one or more objects. A separate view will be created for each object.
# Optionally add a [[Drawing_Workbench|Drawing]] page to the selection. If you do not, the view is inserted into the first page in the document. If there are no pages in the document a new page is created first.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_Drawing.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Drawing|Draft Drawing]]}} button.
# There is a bug in the FreeCAD version 0.19 version of the command. The initial value of the {{PropertyData|Direction}} property is {{Value|[0, 0, 0]}} which is not allowed. For objects on a plane parallel to the XY plane of the global coordinate system it should be changed to {{Value|[0, 0, 1]}}. After changing this property the page and the view may need to be [[Std_Refresh|recomputed]].
