A [[Sketcher_SketchObject|Sketcher SketchObject]], or formally a {{incode|Sketcher::SketchObject}}, is the base element to create 2D objects with the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]].

The {{incode|Sketcher::SketchObject}} is derived from the [[Part_Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]], which means it is a [[Part Feature|Part Feature]] object specialized for 2D geometry. Like the Part2DObject, the SketchObject can be attached to planes and faces. In addition, the SketchObject can handle geometrical constraints.

See [[Property|Property]] for all property types that scripted objects can have.

The [[Sketcher_SketchObject|Sketcher SketchObject]] ({{incode|Sketcher::SketchObject}} class) is derived from the [[Part_Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]] ({{incode|Part::Part2DObject}} class) and inherits all its properties.

The Sketcher SketchObject also has the following additional properties in the [[Property_editor|property editor]]. Hidden properties can be shown by using the {{MenuCommand|Show hidden}} command in the context menu of the [[Property_editor|property editor]].

<span id="Data"></span>
=== Данные ===

{{TitleProperty|Sketch}}

* {{PropertyData|Geometry|GeometryList|Hidden}}: a list of Part geometries that exist inside the sketch.
* {{PropertyData|Constraints|}}: named constraints, if they exist; otherwise it is an empty list {{incode|[]}}.
* {{PropertyData|External Geometry|LinkSubList}}: a list of Part geometries outside this Sketch that are used for reference.
* {{PropertyData|Fully Constrained|Bool|Hidden}}: (read-only) if {{TRUE}} the sketch is fully constrained.

<span id="View"></span>
===Вид===

{{TitleProperty|Auto Constraints}}

* {{PropertyView|Autoconstraints|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} constraints are automatically added when geometry is drawn.
* {{PropertyView|Avoid Redundant|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} redundant auto-constraints are avoided.

{{TitleProperty|Grid}}

* {{PropertyView|Grid Auto|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} the grid is resized based on the boundingbox of the geometry of the sketch.
* {{PropertyView|Grid Size|Length}}: the size of the spacing of the local grid lines in the [[3D_view|3D view]]; it defaults to {{value|10 mm}}.
* {{PropertyView|Show Grid|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} a grid local to the object will be displayed in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. This grid is independent of the [[Draft_ToggleGrid|Draft Grid]].

{{TitleProperty|Visibility automation}}

* {{PropertyView|Editing Workbench|String}}: name of the workbench to activate when editing the sketch; it defaults to {{value|SketcherWorkbench}}.
* {{PropertyView|Force Ortho|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} the camera will be forced to [[Std_OrthographicCamera|orthographic view mode]] when the sketch is opened.
* {{PropertyView|Hide Dependent|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} all objects that depend on the sketch are hidden when the sketch is opened.
* {{PropertyView|Restore Camera|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} the camera position is saved before opening the sketch, and is restored after closing it.
* {{PropertyView|Section View|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} only (parts of) objects behind the sketch plane are visible while the sketch is being edited.
* {{PropertyView|Show Links|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} all objects used in links to external geometry are shown when the sketch is opened.
* {{PropertyView|Show Support|Bool}}: if {{TRUE}} all objects this sketch is attached to are shown when the sketch is opened.
* {{PropertyView|Tempo Vis|PythonObject|Hidden}}: a custom class associated with this object, that handles hiding and showing other objects when opening and closing the sketch.

See [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] for the general information on adding objects to the document.

A SketchObject is created with the {{incode|addObject()}} method of the document.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Sketcher::SketchObject", "Sketch")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}

For [[Python|Python]] subclassing you should create the {{incode|Sketcher::SketchObjectPython}} object.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Sketcher::SketchObjectPython", "CustomSketch")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}
