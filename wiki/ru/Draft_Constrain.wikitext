== Description ==

Apart from entering coordinates or using [[Draft_Snap|snapping]], there is a feature called constraining to help you draw accurately in the [[Image:Workbench_Draft.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] and the [[Image:Workbench_BIM.svg|24px]] [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]]. For each subsequent point you can constrain the movement of the cursor to the X, Y, or Z direction of the [[Draft_SelectPlane|working plane]] coordinate system. This can for example be used to create a perfectly vertical line.

Constraining is available with most [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] and [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]] commands.

== Usage horizontal and vertical constraints ==

# Choose a [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] or [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]] command to create your geometry.
# Pick a first point. A previous point is required.
# Do one of the following:
#* For a horizontal constraint: move the cursor to the left or right of the previous point.
#* For a vertical constraint: move the cursor above or below the previous point.
# Hold down {{KEY|Shift}}.
# The cursor is now constrained.
# Pick the next point.
# If the command is still active: optionally release {{KEY|Shift}} to disable the constraint.
# Always release {{KEY|Shift}} when the command is finished.

== Usage X, Y and Z constraints ==

# Choose a [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] or [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]] command to create your geometry.
# Pick a first point. A previous point is required.
# Press {{KEY|X}}, {{KEY|Y}} or {{KEY|Z}} to specify the direction.
# The cursor is now constrained.
# Pick the next point.
# If the command is still active optionally do one of the following:
#* Press the same key to disable the constraint.
#* Press one of the two other keys to constrain in a different direction.
# X, Y and Z constraints are automatically disabled when the command is finished.

== Notes ==

* Constraining can be combined with [[Draft_Snap|snapping]].
* The [[Draft_Offset|Draft Offset]] command and [[Draft_Trimex|Draft Trimex]] command use a different type of constraining, namely to restrict the operation to a certain segment.

== Preferences ==

See also: [[Preferences_Editor|Preferences Editor]] and [[Draft_Preferences|Draft Preferences]].

* The default {{MenuCommand|Constrain modifier}} key, {{KEY|Shift}}, can be changed: {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences... → Draft → Grid and snapping → Constrain modifier}}.
* The {{MenuCommand|X}}, {{MenuCommand|Y}} and {{MenuCommand|Z}} shortcuts can be changed: {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences... → Draft → Interface → In-command shortcuts}}.
