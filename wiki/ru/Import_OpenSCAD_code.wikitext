== Introduction ==

OpenSCAD, like FreeCAD, is an open source 3D CAD program. But while FreeCAD uses a visual approach, OpenSCAD uses a programming interface to perform 3D operations. The OpenSCAD workbench can be used to import OpenSCAD object code and to have access to some of the mesh operations possible with OpenSCAD.

== Installing OpenSCAD  ==

* Linux users can install from the relevant distribution repositories, such as Debian, openSUSE, Mint, Unbuntu, etc. or from the [http://www.openscad.org/ OpenSCAD homepage].
* Mac Users can download the binaries from the [http://www.openscad.org/ OpenSCAD homepage].
* Windows users can download the program from the [http://www.openscad.org/ OpenSCAD homepage]. Since only the OpenSCAD executable is needed by FreeCAD, Windows users can install the portable version if they like.

== Configuring OpenSCAD workbench in FreeCAD  ==

* Open FreeCAD.
* Switch to [[OpenSCAD_Workbench|OpenSCAD workbench]].
* Choose Edit → Preferences → OpenSCAD from the Top menu.
** Point FreeCAD to the OpenSCAD executable (section: General OpenSCAD settings).
** All the other values on the settings-page could be left at default.

== The sample model ==

Here we will use the example005.scad file from the (old) OpenSCAD examples, but feel free to use any scad file of your liking.

== Importing the model in FreeCAD ==

* In FreeCAD just choose {{KEY| File}}  → {{KEY| Open}} and choose the .scad file you want to import.
* It is not important which workbench is activated, the OpenSCAD workbench itself is only needed when applying special features to your model.
* FreeCAD will import the OpenSCAD file and build up a tree with primitives and boolean operations
* Tutorial finished.
