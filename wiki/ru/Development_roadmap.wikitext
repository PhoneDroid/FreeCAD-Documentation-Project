There is no roadmap for the whole FreeCAD project. If you want to get involved it is best to ask in the [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=10 Developer section] of the [https://forum.freecadweb.org/index.php FreeCAD forum].

The following links may help you get started:
* The [[Organization_chart|Organization chart]] shows who does what in the FreeCAD universe.
* The [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue current issues on GitHub].
* The [[:Category:Roadmap|Roadmap Category on this Wiki]]. Note that there are only very few pages in this category and as such they do not give a good representation of the current FreeCAD development.

Some roadmaps on the Wiki use the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done#Methodology Getting Things Done (GTD)] style for the project document. Here is the [[Project_template|Project template]].
