==Description==

Command for modifying '''Placement'''.
These options relate only to the position and orientation of the object in space, they do not affect other attributes of the shape. The placement is stored internally as a position, and a rotation (rotation axis and angle transformed into a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation quaternion]). While there are several methods to specify a rotation, for instance with a rotation center, this is only used to affect the rotation computation and is not stored for later operations. Similarly, if a rotation axis of (1,1,1) is specified, it may be normalized when stored in the quaternion and appear as (0.58, 0.58, 0.58) when browsing the object later.

==Usage==

The function '''Placement''' can be accessed in several ways:
* via [[Python_scripting_tutorial#Vecteurs_et_Positions|script]] Python in the console and its [[Placement_API|API]].
:[[Image:PlacePyConv10.png|Scripting Placement as y/p/r and Matrix]] 
* or, in the window '''Combo View → Properties → Data → Placement → {{KEY|...}}''',
:[[Image:Tache_Placement_fr_01.png|Task_Placement]]
* or by the menu '''Edit → Placement...'''.

===Enable Placement in Combo View===

* Click a shape to select it.
* Click '''Placement''' (the title, not the little arrow), and a button with an ellipsis {{KEY|...}} appears: [[Image:Tache_Placement_01_fr_00.png|384px|Tache_Placement]] 
* Click on the ellipsis, and the {{MenuCommand|Placement Dialog}} is displayed:

===Options===

{{TitleProperty|Translation}}

* {{TasksTag|X}} [[File:Tache_Placement_Translation_X_fr.gif|150px|Translation in X direction (Click to enlarge)]] Moves the coordinate system of the object in the '''X''' direction in relation to the axis coordinates of origin 0, 0, 0.
* {{TasksTag|Y}} [[File:Tache_Placement_Translation_Y_fr.gif|150px|Translation in the Y direction (Click to enlarge)]] Moves the coordinate system of the object in the '''Y''' direction in relation to the axis coordinates of origin 0, 0, 0.
* {{TasksTag|Z}} [[File:Tache_Placement_Translation_Z_fr.gif|150px|Translation in the Z direction (Click to enlarge)]] Moves the coordinate system of the object in the '''Z''' direction in relation to the axis coordinates of origin 0, 0, 0.

{{TitleProperty|Center}}

* {{TasksTag|X}}: Move the center of rotation in the direction '''X''', from the coordinates of the selected object. (default: 0,0,0).
* {{TasksTag|Y}}: Move the center of rotation in the direction '''Y''', from the coordinates of the selected object. (default: 0,0,0).
* {{TasksTag|Z}}: Move the center of rotation in the direction '''Z''', from the coordinates of the selected object. (default: 0,0,0).
* {{TasksTag|User Defined...}}: Allows you to change the three axes ('''X, Y, Z''') in a single operation [[Image:Part_Revolve_fr_06.png|96px|User Defined]].

{{TitleProperty|Rotation}}

To adjust our '''rotation parameters''' we have two methods available.

* First option. Select ''' Rotation axis with angle '''[[Image:Tache_Placement_fr_05.png|384px|Tache_Placement Option rotation axis and angle]] (Default).
** {{TasksTag|Axis: X}}: The rotation will be on the '''X''' axis.
** {{TasksTag|Axis: Y}}: The rotation will be on the '''Y''' axis.
** {{TasksTag|Axis: Z}}: The rotation will be on the '''Z''' axis. (Default axis).
** {{TasksTag|Angle:}} Angle of rotation in degrees from '''-360.00 °''' to '''360.00 °'''. (Default: '''0.00°''').

* Second option. Select '''Euler Angles''' [[Image:Tache_Placement_fr_04.png|384px|Tache_Placement Option Euler angles]].

This option may be easier to work with, however, even in this mode, there are important things to remember: Positive rotations are in the '''clockwise''' direction, looking '''out''' from the origin along a positive axis. Or to put it differently, the rotations are positive in the '''counterclockwise''' direction, looking '''in''' to the origin along a positive axis.

:* <div id="Yaw"></div>'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics_(fixed-wing_aircraft) Yaw]''' : is a horizontal rotation of a body about a vertical axis.
:* <div id="Pitch"></div>'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics_(fixed-wing_aircraft) Pitch]''' : is defined as an oscillating movement of a vessel fore and aft.
:* <div id="Roll"></div>'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics_(fixed-wing_aircraft) Roll]''' : is a rotary movement of a body about its longitudinal axis (roll axis).

Yaw, pitch and roll refer to the '''attitude''' of an object in 3D space. These terms are commonly used in aviation. The angles are the '''Tait-Bryan angles'''. If you want more information, read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles Euler angles].

[[Image:Tache_Placement_en_03.png|None|Option Euler angles]]

[[Image:Tache_Placement_Lacet_fr_Mini.gif|None|Yaw]]
* {{TasksTag|yaw axis}} '''Yaw is the rotation about the Z axis''', that is to say a rotation from left to right. (The Yaw angle is the '''Psi ψ'''). Value '''-180.00 °''' to '''180.00 ° '''(Default, '''0.00 °''').

[[Image:Tache_Placement_Tangage_fr_Mini.gif|None|Pitch]]
* {{TasksTag|pitch axis}} '''Pitch is rotation about the Y axis''', that is to say nose-up and nose-down. (The Pitch angle is the '''Phi φ'''). Value '''-90.00 °''' to '''90.00 ° '''(Default, '''0.00 °''').

[[Image:Tache_Placement_Roulis_fr_Mini.gif|None|Roll]]
* {{TasksTag|roll axis}} '''Roll is rotation about the X axis''', that is to say wing up and down. (The Roll angle is the '''Thêta θ'''). Value '''-180.00 °''' to '''180.00 ° '''(Default, '''0.00 °''').

* {{TasksTag|Apply incremental changes}} to the placement of the object: Once selected, this option '''virtually''' sets all parameters to zero, to allow you to enter your values ​​without having to calculate with the original parameters of the form. Once you have confirmed with {{KEY|OK}}, the entered values ​​will be added to the values ​​on the form.

* The {{KEY|Reset}} returns all values ​​to '''0,0,0'''.
