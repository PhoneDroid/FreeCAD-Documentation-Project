== Introduction ==

In FreeCAD the word "[[Datum|Datum]]" is normally used to refer to auxiliary geometry in the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]]. These geometrical elements will not form part of the final [[Shape|Shape]] of the [[Body|Body]], but can be used as references and supports for [[Sketch|sketches]] and other types of [[Feature|features]].

The following correspond to elements derived from the {{incode|Part::Datum}} class, itself derived from [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]]:
* [[PartDesign_Point|PartDesign Point]]
* [[PartDesign_Line|PartDesign Line]]
* [[PartDesign_Plane|PartDesign Plane]]
* [[PartDesign_CoordinateSystem|PartDesign CoordinateSystem]]

The following are derived directly from [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]]:
* [[PartDesign_ShapeBinder|PartDesign ShapeBinder]]
* [[PartDesign_SubShapeBinder|PartDesign SubShapeBinder]]

==Usage==

# Switch to the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].
# Press {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Body.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]]}}.
# Select the Origin of the Body, and make it visible by pressing the {{KEY|Space}} bar in your keyboard.
# Press {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Plane.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Plane|PartDesign Plane]]}} to open the plane [[task_panel|task panel]].
# In the [[3D_view|3D view]], click on one of the standard planes, for example, the XY plane. Then press {{Button|OK}} to close the task panel.
# Now in the [[tree_view|tree view]], select the newly created DatumPlane, and then press {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_NewSketch.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_NewSketch|PartDesign NewSketch]]}}.
# Create a closed wire, and then use {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Pad.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]]}} to extrude the sketch, and create an initial solid.

Now you can move and rotate the DatumPlane as you wish, by changing its properties in the [[property_editor|property editor]], and the Sketch and Pad will follow its new [[Placement|Placement]].

You can add other types of datums to be used with other sketches and features.

== Notes ==

Since they appeared in v0.17, datum objects were intended to be used inside [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Bodies]]. However, since they are useful "reference" objects with different [[Part_EditAttachment|attachment methods]], it has been proposed that they should be available outside of the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]]. In this way, they will be usable in all workbenches as supporting geometry, particularly in the context of creating [[Assembly|assemblies]].
