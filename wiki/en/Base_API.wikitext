The Base module is contained inside the FreeCAD module and contains constructors for different types of objects heavily used in FreeCAD. 

{{APIClass b|BoundBox|[Xmin,Ymin,Zmin,Xmax,Ymax,Zmax]}}
{{APIClass b|BoundBox|Tuple, Tuple}}
{{APIClass|BoundBox|Vector, Vector|
Creates a bounding box.
A bounding box is an orthographic cube which is a way to describe outer boundaries. You get a bounding box from a lot of 3D types. It is often used to check if a 3D entity lies in the range of another object. Checking for bounding interference first can save a lot of computing time!}}

{{APIClass|Matrix| |Creates a 4x4 [[Matrix_API|Matrix]], that can be used to apply transformations to objects.}}

{{APIClass b|Vector| }}
{{APIClass|Vector|x, y, z|Creates a FreeCAD 3D [[Vector_API|Vector]], representing a 3D point or a direction.}}

{{APIClass|Placement| |Creates a [[Placement_API|Placement]].}}
