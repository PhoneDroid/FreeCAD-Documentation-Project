==Description==

The [[Image:Curves_GordonSurface.svg|24px]] [[Curves_GordonSurface|Curves GordonSurface]] tool spans a surface on a grid of guide curves and profile curves.

At least a frame of 2 guide curves and 2 profile curves is needed for a Gordon surface, additional curves in between allow for a more detailed control of its curvature.

==Usage==

# Select the lines that define the grid of the surface in the appropriate order:
#* Select the guide curves (first direction) from one edge via the intermediate curves to the other edge.
#* Select the profile curves (second direction) again from one edge via the intermediate curves to the other edge.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Curves_GordonSurface.svg|16px]] [[Curves_GordonSurface|Gordon surface]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Surfaces → [[Image:Curves_GordonSurface.svg|16px]] Gordon surface}} option from the menu.
# A '''Gordon''' object is created.
# Optionally edit the values in the [[Property_editor|Property editor]] to choose a different output type and adjust the related properties (see Properties below).

==Notes==

* Change the {{PropertyData|Output}} property to {{Value|Wireframe}} to create a Gordon grid. It uses the same frame curves but may have different numbers of curves in between.
*: {{PropertyData|Samples U}} and {{PropertyData|Samples V}} properties determine the density of the grid in U and V direction accordingly.
*: Samples equal the number of segments between the frame curves, 3 and 5 in this example:

* The input curves of each group (guides and profiles) should touch all curves of the other group. In other words, they must form a grid or net pattern as shown here:

[[File:grid.png|200px]]

* In general, the surface normal of the resulting Gordon surface will be determined by the direction of the profiles.
*: In this example, the surface on the left, the profiles were drawn from +Y to -Y and the resulting surface normal is +Z
*: And on the right, the profiles are drawn from -Y to +Y, resulting in the surface normal oriented -Z.

* [[Part_Extrude|Part Extrude]] can be used to create a solid from the surface.

* [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]] can also create a solid from the surface. Dragging the surface into a Body creates a [[PartDesign_Body#Base_Feature|Base Feature]] that can then be padded.

==Properties==

See also: [[Property_editor|Property editor]].

A '''Gordon''' object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

===Data===

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyData|Output|Enumeration}}: Defines the output type: 
** {{Value|Surface}} (default): The result is a single Surface shape.
** {{Value|Wireframe}}: The result is a grid of guide and profile curves.

{{TitleProperty|Gordon}}

* {{PropertyData|Max Ctrl Pts|Integer}}: Max Number of control points
* {{PropertyData|Sources|LinkList}}: Curve network. User selected lines that are used to create the Gordon surface.
* {{PropertyData|Tol2D|Float|Hidden}}: Parametric tolerance
* {{PropertyData|Tol3D|Float}}: 3D tolerance

{{TitleProperty|Surface}}

* {{PropertyData|Flip Normal|Bool}}: Flip surface normal

{{TitleProperty|Wireframe}}

* {{PropertyData|Samples U|Integer|Hidden}}: Number of samples in U direction.
* {{PropertyData|Samples V|Integer|Hidden}}: Number of samples in V direction.
