==Description==

{{Button|[[File:Surface_Sections.svg|16px]] [[Surface_Sections|Surface Sections]]}} is used to create a surface from edges that represent transversal sections of a surface.

[[File:Surface_Sections_edges_example.png|x250px]] [[File:Surface_Sections_example.png|x250px]]

{{Caption|Left: control edges (transversal sections). Right: surface produced from these edges.}}

==Usage==

# Make sure you have at lease two edges or curves in space. For example, these can be created with tools of the [[File:Workbench_Draft.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] or the [[File:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher]].
# Press the {{Button|[[File:Surface_Sections.svg|16px]] [[Surface_Sections|Surface sections]]}} button.
# Press {{Button|Add edge}}.
# Use the pointer to pick the desired edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]; a preview of the final shape will be shown after selecting two valid edges.
# Press {{Button|OK}} to complete the operation.

== Options ==

* {{Button|Add edge}}: press once to start picking edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. Individual lines such as {{Button|[[File:Draft_BSpline.svg|16px]] [[Draft_BSpline|Draft BSplines]]}} and {{Button|[[File:Sketcher_CreateBSpline.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_CreateBSpline|Sketcher BSplines]]}} can be chosen, as well as any edge from solid objects, like those of {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Body.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Bodies]]}} and {{Button|[[File:Part_Primitives.svg|16px]] [[Part_Primitives|Part Primitives]]}}.
* {{Button|Remove edge}}: press once to start picking edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]; these must be edges that were previously picked with {{Button|Add edge}}.
* {{KEY|Right mouse button}}: open the context menu and select {{Button|Remove}}, or press {{KEY|Del}} in the keyboard, to remove the currently selected edge in the list.
* {{MenuCommand|Drag}}: drag the currently selected element in the list in order to change the order in which it will be processed; the list is processed from top to bottom.
* Press {{Button|Cancel}} or {{KEY|Esc}} to abort the current operation.

==Properties==

A [[Surface_Sections|Surface Sections]] ({{incode|Surface::Sections}} class) is derived from the basic [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class, through the {{incode|Part::Spline}} subclass), therefore it shares all the latter's properties.

In addition to the properties described in [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]], the Surface Sections has the following properties in the [[property_editor|property editor]].

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Sections}}

* {{PropertyData|NSections|LinkSubList}}: a list of edges that will be used to build the surface.

=== View === 

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyView|Control Points|Bool}}: it defaults to {{FALSE}}; if set to {{TRUE}}, it will show an overlay with the control points of the surface.

== Twisting of the surface ==

The shape of the surface depends on the direction of the chosen edges; if edges are selected and the result is a surface that "twists" on itself, one of the edges may need its list of vertices in the reverse order. See the information in {{Button|[[File:Surface_GeomFillSurface.svg|16px]] [[Surface_GeomFillSurface|GeomFillSurface]]}} for a more complete explanation.

[[File:Surface_twisting_example_smooth.png|330px]] [[File:Surface_twisting_example_twisted.png|330px]]

== Scripting ==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

The Surface Sections tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by adding the {{incode|Surface::Sections}} object.
* The edges to be used to define the surface must be assigned as a [[FeaturePython_Custom_Properties#App::PropertyLinkSubList|LinkSubList]] to the {{incode|NSections}} property of the object.
* All objects with edges need to be computed before they can be used as input for the properties of the Sections object.
