== Overview==

DynamicData is an [[External_workbenches|external workbench]] with which one can create a container object for holding custom properties.

With this workbench it's possible to create a new custom [[property]] of just about any type that FreeCAD supports. For example a Length property or a [[Placement]] property.  These custom properties can then be used in [[Expressions]] just like any other property.  For example, you could create a Length property called "Width" and refer to it when constraining a sketch element.  Then when the "Width" property is changed, the sketch constraint will automatically update.  This is similar to the way one can use a spreadsheet, but is more interactive in that the properties can be changed while still being able to see the [[3D view]] and also allows for a wider variety of property types.

Some features include: 

*ability to import named constraints from a sketch
*ability to copy properties or set property values from one object to another
*container objects remain compatible with FreeCAD installations that do not have the workbench installed

==Installation==

This workbench can be installed from the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. For manual installation see [[Installing_more_workbenches|Installing more workbenches]].

== External workbenches ==

FreeCAD workbenches are easy to program in [[Python|Python]], there are therefore many people developing additional workbenches outside of the FreeCAD main developers.

The [[external workbenches|external workbenches]] page has some information and tutorials on some of them, and the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons FreeCAD Addons] project aims at gathering them and making them easily installable from within FreeCAD.

New workbenches are in development, stay tuned!
