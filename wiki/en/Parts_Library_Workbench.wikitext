How to [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library here]

The library is a simple container for FreeCAD (.fcstd) and STEP (.stp) files. You can download it anywhere and import its files in your FreeCAD projects. Inside the library, there is also a FreeCAD [[Macro_PartsLibrary|Macro PartsLibrary]] that you can place in your FreeCAD macros folder. That macro creates a browser window inside FreeCAD, from which you can easily add the parts by double-clicking them.
