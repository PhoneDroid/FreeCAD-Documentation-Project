== Introduction ==

This tutorial explains how to add a pitch circle to a [[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw]] view. It assumes that the model is a [[Image:PartDesign_Body.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]] with at least three holes in a circular pattern. For the circle a separate sketch will be created. A similar procedure can be used in other situations and to add other annotation-like elements to [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw]] views.

In FreeCAD version 0.20 and above a pitch circle can be created with the [[TechDraw_ExtensionHoleCircle|TechDraw ExtensionHoleCircle]] tool.

== Create the sketch for the circle ==

# Activate the [[Image:PartDesign_Body.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]]. This will also activate the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]], if required.
# In the [[3D_view|3D view]] select the correct face belonging to the body.
# Create a new sketch with the [[Image:PartDesign_NewSketch.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_NewSketch|PartDesign NewSketch]] command.
# The sketch will be attached to the selected face.
# Call the [[Image:Sketcher_External.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_External|Sketcher External]] command.
# Select three circular edges (holes) from the body.
# Use the [[Image:Sketcher_Create3PointCircle.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_Create3PointCircle|Sketcher Create3PointCircle]] command to create a circle constrained to the center points of the external geometry.
# The sketch should now be fully constrained.
# Close the sketch.

== Create the TechDraw view ==

# Switch to the [[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]].
# If you don't have one already: create a [[Image:TechDraw_PageDefault.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_PageDefault|TechDraw page]].
# Make sure the [[3D_view|3D view]] is properly aligned.
# Hold down the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key and in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] select the body and the sketch that was just just created.
# Insert a new view by calling the [[Image:TechDraw_View.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_View|TechDraw View]] command.
# Switch to the  [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw]] page.
# Select the circle.
# Call the [[Image:TechDraw_DecorateLine.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_DecorateLine|TechDraw DecorateLine]] command.
# Change the {{MenuCommand|Style}} and {{MenuCommand|Weight}} of the circle.
