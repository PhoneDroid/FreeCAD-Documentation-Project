The wide variety of channels and communities this server attracts means it can be good for having discussions with people in related communities. The [https://discordapp.com/invite/P9p9eHn OpenFOAM] server has a "freecad-salome-etc" channel, where you might be able to find people more interested in the overlap between FreeCAD and computational fluid dynamics tools like OpenFOAM.

However, please do not use chat groups as the main medium of exchanging data. They are not indexed by the search engines and information produced on these platforms is not properly accumulated, as it is on forums, blog posts, or wiki pages.
