==Description== 

'''Part Mirror''' creates a new object (image) which is a reflection of the original object (source). The image object is created behind a mirror plane. The mirror plane may be standard plane ('''XY''', '''YZ''', or '''XZ'''), any plane parallel to a standard plane, or ({{Version|1.0}}) any arbitrary plane by using a reference object.

An example:

{{Caption|Before}}

[[Image:PARTMirrorAfterv11.png]]

{{Caption|After mirrored through YZ plane}}

==Usage==

[[Image:PartMirroring_Scr1.png]]

# Optionally select one or more source objects.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Mirror.svg|16px]] [[Part_Mirror|Mirroring...]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_Mirror.svg|16px]] Mirroring...}} option from the menu.
# If you have not yet selected objects or want to change the selection: pick one or more objects from the '''Shapes''' list.
# Do one of the following:
#* Select a standard '''Mirror plane''' from the dropdown list.
#* {{Version|1.0}}: Select a reference object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] or the [[3D_view|3D view]]. The reference object can be any planar face or circular edge.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button.
# For each source object a separate Part Mirror object is created.

When the select button label says {{Button|Selecting}} you are in reference selection mode and there is a selection gate in effect, which disallows the selection of unsupported reference objects. Click the button to toggle the selection gate off, the button label then changes to {{Button|Select reference}}.

The mirror plane is defined by a {{PropertyData|Normal}} (direction) and a {{PropertyData|Base}} (position). When the {{PropertyData|Mirror Plane}} property contains a reference object these properties are made read-only as they are then computed based on that object. The plane is infinite even if the reference object is not.

A reference object can be a planar face, such as the face of a [[Part_Box|Part Box]], a circular edge, a [[PartDesign_Plane|Datum Plane]], an [[App_OriginGroupExtension|origin plane]] of a [[Std_Part|Std Part]] container, or any object with a single planar face or single circular edge. There is also support for [[App_Link|Links]]. Note, however, that B-spline surfaces, such as [[Part_RuledSurface|ruled surfaces]] or [[Part_Loft|loft faces]] are not supported.

==Options== 

If a standard plane instead of a reference object is selected, the '''Base point''' boxes can be used to move it. Only one of the '''X''', '''Y''', or '''Z''' boxes is effective for a given standard plane.

==Notes==

* [[App_Link|App Link]] objects linked to the appropriate object types and [[App_Part|App Part]] containers with the appropriate visible objects inside can also be used as source objects. {{Version|0.20}}
* After selecting a standard mirror plane, the {{PropertyData|Normal}} and {{PropertyData|Base}} of the Part Mirror object can be changed to any value. So that even without a reference object you are not restricted to the standard planes.
