==Options==

===Find file / Find in files===

: {{Version|1.0}}

: These two input boxes can be used to filter macros from the file list on the '''User macros''' tab or the '''System macros''' tab. You may use regular expressions or simply enter text. All matches are case-insensitive.

: '''Find file''' filters the list by filename. Only filenames that match the entered text will appear in the list. '''Find in files''' filters the list by file content. Only files whose text content matches the entered text will appear in the list.

: Remove all text from a filter's input box to disable it. If both input boxes contain text, both filters are applied. Filtering may result in an empty list.
