==Description==

The '''TechDraw Quadrant''' tool adds three [[TechDraw_CosmeticVertex|cosmetic vertices]] along the length of one or more selected edges. The vertices are placed at 25%, 50% and 75% of the length of the edges. For a circular edge this results in cosmetic vertices at 90°, 180° and 270°, in addition to its geometric vertex at 0°.

==Usage==

# Select one or more edges in a view. Any edge can be selected, not just circles.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:TechDraw_Quadrants.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_Quadrants|Add Quadrant Vertices]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|TechDraw → Add Vertices → [[Image:TechDraw_Quadrants.svg|16px]] Add Quadrant Vertices}} option from the menu.

==Notes==

* The created cosmetic vertices are not parametrically linked to the selected edges.
* To delete a cosmetic vertex select it and press {{KEY|Delete}}. {{Version|1.0}}

==Properties==

Cosmetic vertices have no properties of their own, as they are not document objects. They share color and size settings with regular geometry vertices.

==Scripting==

See also: [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ Autogenerated API documentation] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

Cosmetic vertices are not accessible from [[Macros|macros]] or the [[Python|Python]] console at this time.  This snippet will remove all cosmetic vertices from the view.
