==Description==

The '''TechDraw ActiveView''' tool inserts a bitmap image of the active 3D window into a drawing page.

[[File:TechDraw_ActiveView_example.png]]
{{Caption|A simple view from the 3D model.}}

==Usage==

# Navigate to the correct [[3D_view|3D view]].
# If there are multiple drawing pages in the document: optionally select the desired page in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:TechDraw_ActiveView.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_ActiveView|Insert Active View (3D View)]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|TechDraw → Views From Other Workbenches → [[Image:TechDraw_ActiveView.svg|16px]] Insert Active View (3D View)}} option from the menu.
# If there are multiple drawing pages in the document and you have not yet selected a page, the {{MenuCommand|Page Chooser}} dialog box opens:
## Select the desired page.
## Press the {{Button|OK}} button.
# The {{MenuCommand|ActiveView to TD View}} task panel opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button.

== Options ==

The following can be specified: 

* {{MenuCommand|Crop}}: Crop the generated bitmap.
* {{MenuCommand|Width}}: The width (in mm) to crop the generated view.
* {{MenuCommand|Height}}: The height (in mm) to crop the generated view.
* {{MenuCommand|No Background}}: If checked, the generated bitmap will have a transparent background.
* {{MenuCommand|Solid Background}}: If checked, the generated will have a background of the selected color.
* {{MenuCommand|Use 3d Background}}: If checked, the generated bitmap will use the background from the 3D window.

== Notes ==

* ActiveViews are static once generated, they are never updated with changes to the 3D model.
* An ActiveView behind the scenes is an [[TechDraw_Image|Image]]. Its {{PropertyData|Scale Type}} is therefore always initialized as {{Value|Custom}}.
* In {{VersionMinus|0.20}} ActiveView was a [[TechDraw_Symbol|Symbol]].
