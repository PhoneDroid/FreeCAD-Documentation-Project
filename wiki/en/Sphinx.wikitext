== Introduction ==

[[Sphinx|Sphinx]] is a documentation system similar to [[Doxygen|Doxygen]], designed primarily to document [[Python|Python]] code. With the use of [https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe "Breathe"] it can also be used to parse C++ code, so it can be used in projects that mix C++ and Python.

Visit the [https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ Sphinx] website to learn more about the system, and consult the [https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/contents.html Sphinx manual] for the full information.
