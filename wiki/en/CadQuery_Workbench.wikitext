{{VeryImportantMessage|(January 2021) 
The active development of CadQuery has moved away from FreeCAD [https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery#why-this-fork], offering now a stand-alone GUI with the CQ-editor [https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor].
The CadQuery workbench is '''no longer actively maintained''', but may receive sporadic fixes by its author.
