== Installing ==

=== Stable ===

If you want to install at the user level or don't have sudo privileges add the {{incode|--user}} flag to the following commands.

{{code|lang=bash|code=
# add flathub repo just to be sure as it might not be enabled if it is your first time using flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub org.freecad.FreeCAD
}}

=== Development versions ===

If you want to install at the user level or don't have sudo privileges add the {{incode|--user}} flag to the following commands.

{{code|lang=bash|code=
# flathub-beta repo is not enabled by default
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub-beta org.freecad.FreeCAD
}}

== Running ==

You may start the flatpak using the desktop file or using the following command:

{{code|lang=bash|code=
flatpak run org.freecad.FreeCAD
}}

The different branches can be installed in parallel. To choose which one to run use the {{incode|--branch}} flag:

{{code|lang=bash|code=
flatpak run --branch=beta org.freecad.FreeCAD
}}

To run a specific executable (for example {{incode|FreeCADCmd}} to run without GUI) from the flatpak use the {{incode|--command}} flag:

{{code|lang=bash|code=
flatpak run --command=FreeCADCmd org.freecad.FreeCAD
}}
