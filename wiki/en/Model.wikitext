== Introduction ==

In FreeCAD the word "[[Model|Model]]" is normally used to refer to any 3D object, or collection of objects, created in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

That is, a "Model" can be anything created by the tools of FreeCAD, for example, the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] or any of the other [[Workbenches|workbenches]].

== Notes ==

In informal usage, the word "[[Drawing|Drawing]]" may be used with the same meaning as "Model". However, when more precision is required, the distinction must be made.
* A "Model" is any 3D or 2D object created in the [[3D_view|3D view]], for example, a PartDesign [[Body|Body]], or [[Part|Part]] containing many such Bodies.
* A "Drawing" is a strictly 2D projection of that "Model", usually created with the [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]] tools. This "Drawing" is usually intended for printing or for export.
* The "Model" is usually the real object intended for manufacturing, while the "Drawing" is an auxiliary, flat representation of that "Model" which will be used for reference and documentation purposes.
