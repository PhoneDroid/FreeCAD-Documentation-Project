==Description==

Sometimes when a user applies changes to the model, FreeCAD does not seem to recognize/integrate them. In addition to that, the blue {{Button|[[Image:Std_Refresh.svg|24px]] [[Std_Refresh|Refresh/Recompute]]}} button remains greyed out. Hence this small macro was designed to force a manual recompute of the model.

'''Note:''' As of {{VersionPlus|0.17}} the effect of this macro can be achieved through the GUI. Right-click project in [[Tree_view|model tree view]], and pick {{KEY|Mark to recompute}} from the context menu. What this does is make the Refresh/Recompute icon active again. Now press on the [[Image:Std_Refresh.svg|24px]] [[Std_Refresh|Refresh/Recompute]] button to trigger a recompute.

==Usage==

Run the macro when necessary.
