== Introduction ==

{{TOCright}}

[[Assembly4_Workbench|Assembly4]] is an [[external_workbenches|external workbench]] that is used to perform assembly of different bodies contained in a single file or in multiple documents. It was created in the v0.19 development cycle to take advantage of Assembly3 branch's new features, such as the [[App_Link|App Link]] object, and the new [[expressions|expression engine]].

It was developed with the idea that a true constraint solver was not needed, and instead the [[expressions|expression engine]] was enough to establish relationships between different local coordinate systems attached to bodies. Thus its prototype name was "Assembly without solver" or AWS.

== Installation==

Assembly4 can be installed from the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]].

== Compatibility ==

Assembly4 was developed from the new tools created for [[Assembly3_Workbench|Assembly3]], in particular, the [[App_Link|App Link]] object and the improved [[expressions|expression engine]].

Assembly4 was inspired by [[File:A2p_workbench.svg|24px]] [[A2plus_Workbench|A2plus]] and [[File:Assembly3_workbench_icon.svg|24px]] [[Assembly3_Workbench|Assembly3]] but it is not compatible with them. If you have older models made in those two workbenches, you should use those workbenches to open your models only.
