== Introduction ==

In FreeCAD the word "[[Shape|Shape]]" is normally used to refer to a [[Part_TopoShape|Part TopoShape]] ({{incode|Part::TopoShape}} class), a type of object that gives an element its 3D geometrical and parametric representation (cube, pyramid, sphere, cylinder, fusion, etc.).

Essentially all objects that are displayed in the [[3D view|3D view]] have a [[Part_TopoShape|TopoShape]], with the exception of "[[Mesh|Meshes]]", which have a [[Mesh_MeshObject|MeshObject]] ({{incode|Mesh::MeshObject}} class).

See [[Part_TopoShape|Part TopoShape]] for more information about this type of object.

==Usage==

Shapes are normally created by internal functions of the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]], and are ultimately defined by the [[OpenCASCADE|OpenCASCADE Technology]] kernel (OCCT).

Once a Shape is created, it can be used and modified by all [[Workbenches|workbenches]] by creating [[scripted objects|scripted objects]] around that Shape.

Essentially, every object derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class) is expected to hold and manipulate a Shape.

Any OpenCascade Shape has a tesselation mainly to view the Shape on screen. More information about this can be found in this German [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=77521&start=10#p674947 forum post] and in the [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_user_guides__mesh.html OpenCascad Mesh documentation].

== Notes ==

In informal usage, a "Shape" may be any geometrical figure that is visible in the [[3D view|3D view]], and thus its concept may be confused with that of "[[Body|Body]]" or "[[Part|Part]]".

However, when more precision is required, the distinction must be made.
* A "[[Body|Body]]" is an object derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class), created with the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].
* A "Shape" is an internal object, embedded within the "[[Body|Body]]".
* A "[[Part|Part]]" is used to group several "[[Body|Bodies]]" to form an [[assembly|assembly]]. A "Part" has a collection of "Shapes", but doesn't have a "Shape" of its own.
