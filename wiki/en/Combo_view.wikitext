== Introduction ==

The [[Combo_view|Combo view]] appears in a panel called '''Model'''. It combines the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] (upper section) and the [[Property_editor|Property editor]] (lower section).

The [[Task_panel|Task panel]], which used to be part of the Combo view, is a separate panel called '''Tasks''' in {{VersionPlus|1.0}}. It can be [[#Dock_Task_panel_on_top_of_Combo_view|docked]] on top of the Combo view to achieve the compact layout of earlier versions.

== Dock Task panel on top of Combo view ==

# Make sure the Combo view is docked along an edge of the FreeCAD window.
# Move the cursor to the very top of the Task panel.
# The arrow becomes a hand.
# Hold down the left mouse button and drag the Task panel on top of the Combo view.
# Move vertically until both the upper and lower sections of the Combo view are highlighted.<br>[[File:Tasks_Dockable.png|200px]]
# Release the mouse button.

== Preferences ==

See also: [[Preferences_Editor|Preferences Editor]].

The Combo view is available if {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences... → General → General → Tree view mode}} is set to {{Value|Combined}}. If it is set to {{Value|Independent}} the Tree view and the Property editor appear as separate panels.
