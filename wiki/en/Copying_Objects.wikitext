==Overview==

Like many other computer programs FreeCAD has the ability to cut, copy and paste objects. [[Document_structure|Document]] objects may be freely copied within a document or between documents using the [[Image:Std_Copy.svg|24px]] [[Std_Copy|Std Copy]], [[Image:Std_Paste.svg|24px]] [[Std_Paste|Std Paste]] and [[Std_DuplicateSelection|Std DuplicateSelection]] commands.

Please consider that the copy-pasted objects are not dependent on the original. If you want dependent clones please use [[Image:Draft_Clone.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Clone|Draft Workbench's Clone]] or [[Image:PartDesign_Clone.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Clone|Part Design Workbench's Clone]]. If you need neither a dependent clone nor a parametric replica, you may also use [[Image:Part_SimpleCopy.svg|24px]] [[Part_SimpleCopy| Part Workbench's Simple Copy]]. For patterned clones, please look into the [[Copying_Objects#Other_Methods| Other Methods section]] of this page.

==Copying Linked Objects==

If an object to be copied has links to object(s) not in the selection, FreeCAD will ask if the unselected objects should be included in the copy operation.

==Finding and Positioning Pasted Object(s)==

After a copy-paste operation, it may not be obvious where the new objects are located in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. That is because the new objects have the same [[Placement|Placement]] property as their originals. Toggle the Visibility property ({{KEY|Spacebar}}) to hide the originals and then move the copies to their correct position, for example using [[Image:Std_TransformManip.svg|24px]] [[Std_TransformManip|Std TransformManip]] or  [[Image:Std_Placement.svg|24px]] [[Std_Placement|Std Placement]].

==Other Methods==

Like most things in FreeCAD, there are many ways of making a copy.  For more ideas, look at: 
* PartDesign: [[PartDesign_Mirrored|Mirror]], [[PartDesign_LinearPattern|Linear Pattern]], [[PartDesign_PolarPattern|Polar Pattern]], [[PartDesign_MultiTransform|MultiTransform]]
* Part: [[Part_Mirror|Mirror]], [[Part_SimpleCopy|Create simple copy]]
* Draft: [[Draft_Offset|Offset]], [[Draft_Scale|Scale]], [[Draft_OrthoArray|Array]], [[Draft_PathArray|PathArray]], [[Draft_Clone|Clone]], [[Draft_Mirror|Mirror]]
