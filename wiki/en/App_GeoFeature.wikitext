== Introduction ==

[[File:Feature.svg|32px]]

An [[App_GeoFeature|App GeoFeature]] object, or formally an {{incode|App::GeoFeature}}, is the base class of most objects that will display geometrical elements in the [[3D_view|3D view]] because it includes a {{PropertyData|Placement}} property.

== Usage ==

The [[App_GeoFeature|App GeoFeature]] is an internal object, so it cannot be created from the graphical interface. It is generally not meant to be used directly, rather it can be sub-classed to get a bare-bones object that only has a basic {{PropertyData|Placement}} property to define its position in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

Some of the most important derived objects are the following:
* The [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] class, the parent of most objects with 2D and 3D [[Part_TopoShape|topological shapes]].
* The [[Mesh_Feature|Mesh Feature]] class, the parent of most objects made from [[Mesh_MeshObject|meshes]], not solids.
* The [[FEM_Mesh|Fem FemMeshObject]] class, the parent of finite element meshes created with the [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]].
* The [[CAM_scripting#The_Path_feature|Path Feature]] and [[CAM_scripting#Python_features|Path FeaturePython]] classes, the parents of objects created with the [[CAM_Workbench|CAM Workbench]] for use in CNC machining.
* The [[App_Part|App Part]] class, which defines [[Std_Part|Std Parts]] that can be used as containers of bodies to perform assemblies.

When creating this object in [[Python|Python]], instead of sub-classing {{incode|App::GeoFeature}}, you should sub-class {{incode|App::GeometryPython}} because the latter includes a default view provider, and {{incode|Proxy}} attributes for the object itself, and its view provider. See [[App_GeoFeature#Scripting|Scripting]].

== Properties App GeoFeature ==

See [[Property|Property]] for all property types that scripted objects can have.

The [[App_GeoFeature|App GeoFeature]] ({{incode|App::GeoFeature}} class) is derived from the basic [[App_DocumentObject|App DocumentObject]] ({{incode|App::DocumentObject}} class) and inherits all its properties. In addition it has a {{PropertyData|Placement}} property, which controls its position in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

== Properties App GeometryPython ==

See [[Property|Property]] for all property types that scripted objects can have.

The [[App_GeoFeature|App GeometryPython]] ({{incode|App::GeometryPython}} class) is derived from the basic [[App_GeoFeature|App GeoFeature]] ({{incode|App::GeoFeature}} class) and inherits all its properties. It also has several additional properties.

These are the properties available in the [[Property_editor|property editor]]. Hidden properties can be shown by using the {{MenuCommand|Show hidden}} command in the context menu of the [[Property_editor|property editor]].

See [[Part_Feature#Properties|Part Feature]] for an explanation of the properties listed below.

== Scripting ==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]] and [[Scripted_objects|scripted objects]].

See [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] for the general information on adding objects to the document.

A GeoFeature is created with the {{incode|addObject()}} method of the document. If you would like to create an object with a 2D or 3D [[Part_TopoShape|topological shape]], it may be better to create one of the sub-classes specialized for handling shapes, for example [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] or [[Part_Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]].

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("App::GeoFeature", "Name")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}

For [[Python|Python]] subclassing you should create the {{incode|App::GeometryPython}} object.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("App::GeometryPython", "Name")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}
