==Introduction==

This page aims to document how to use [https://numpy.org/ NumPy] with FreeCAD.

<code>numpy</code> comes installed as a dependency of FreeCAD, therefore you can <code>import numpy as np</code> without having to first install it like in normal Python project environments.

== Convert Vector list between FreeCAD Python and NumPy ==

=== From Python to NumPy ===

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App
import numpy as np

vector_list = [App.Vector(1, 0, 0), App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Vector(0, 3, 0)]
numpy_array = np.asarray(vector_list)
print(numpy_array)
}}

Output is:

{{Code|lang=text|code=
[[ 1.  0.  0.]
 [ 1.  2.  3.]
 [ 0.  3.  0.]]
}}

=== From NumPy to Python ===

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App
import numpy as np

cad_list = [App.Vector(itm) for itm in numpy_array]
print(cad_list)
}}

Output is:

{{Code|lang=text|code=
[Vector (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), Vector (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), Vector (0.0, 3.0, 0.0)]
}}
