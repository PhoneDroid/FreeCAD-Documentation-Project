{{GuiCommand|Name=Drawing Openbrowser|Workbenches=[[Drawing Workbench|Drawing]], Complete|MenuLocation=Drawing → Open Browser|Shortcut=none}}

== Description ==

This command allows you to display a selected [[Drawing Landscape A3|Drawing page]] using FreeCAD's internal web browser. The normal Drawing page viewer of FreeCAD is based on [http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtsvg/svgrendering.html Qt's built-in SVG rendering module], which only supports a tiny subset of the full SVG specification. As a result, some more advanced SVG features, such as pattern fills or multiline texts are not supported by this viewer. The FreeCAD internal web browser, however, is built on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit webkit], which is one of the best SVG renderers available, and will correctly render your page with all its features.

==Usage==

# Create a [[Drawing Landscape A3|Drawing page]]
# Add some [[Drawing View|views]] or other content to your page
# [[Std_Refresh|Refresh]] the view if a Drawing view wasn't opened
# Press the {{KEY|[[Image:Drawing Openbrowser.png|16px]] [[Drawing Openbrowser]]}} button

== Limitations ==

* A page opened in the web browser will not refresh automatically on changes. You must use right-click → reload manually.
