==Description==

The [[Image:PartDesign_Thickness.svg|24px]] '''PartDesign Thickness''' tool transforms a solid body into a hollow object with at least one open face, giving to each of its remaining faces a uniform thickness. It adds a '''Thickness''' object to the document with its corresponding representation in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].

[[File:PartDesign_Thickness_example.svg|600px]]
{{Caption|Base solid (A) →  Solid with selected face to be opened (B) →  Resulting hollow object (C)}}

==Usage==

=== Add a thickness ===

# Optionally [[PartDesign_Body#Active_status|activate]] the Body to apply the Thickness to.
# Select one or more faces of the Body.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:PartDesign_Thickness.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Thickness|Thickness]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part Design → Apply a dress-up feature → [[Image:PartDesign_Thickness.svg|16px]] Thickness}} option from the menu.
# If there is no active Body, and there are two or more Bodies in the document, the {{MenuCommand|Active Body Required}} dialog will open and prompt you to activate one. If there is a single Body it will be activated automatically.
# The {{MenuCommand|Thickness parameters}} [[Task_panel|task panel]] opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button to finish.


:''Remember'':
:* Since there must be at least one face for the feature, the last remaining face in the list cannot be removed.

=== Edit a thickness ===

# Do one of the following:
#* Double-click the Thickness object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]
#* Right-click the Thickness object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] and select {{MenuCommand|Edit Thickness}} from the context menu.
# The {{MenuCommand|Thickness parameters}} [[Task_panel|task panel]] opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button to finish.

==Options==

* {{MenuCommand|Add face}}: Add faces to the selection by pressing the {{Button|Add face}} button and selecting more faces. 
* {{MenuCommand|Remove face}}: Choose a way to remove faces from the selection:
** Select one or more faces in the list and press the {{KEY|Del}} key or right-click the list and select {{MenuCommand|Remove}} from the context menu.
** Press the {{Button|Remove face}} button. All previously selected faces are highlighted in purple. Select each face to be removed.
* {{MenuCommand|Thickness}}: Set the wall thickness either by editing the value or by clicking the up/down arrows.
* {{MenuCommand|Mode}}:
** {{MenuCommand|Skin}}: Select this option if you want to get an item like a vase, headless but with the bottom. Only this option can be selected.
** {{MenuCommand|Pipe}}: Not implemented. See [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=484495#p484495 this forum topic].
** {{MenuCommand|Recto Verso}}: Not implemented. See [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=484495#p484495 this forum topic].
* {{MenuCommand|Join Type}}:
** {{MenuCommand|Arc}}: When non-tangential faces are offset, new faces that do not intersect are joined by a fillet with a radius equal to the defined thickness.
** {{MenuCommand|Intersection}}: When non-tangential faces are offset, new faces that do not intersect are extended to meet at their virtual intersection.
* {{MenuCommand|Intersection}}: When checked, self-intersections in certain models are avoided. This option is not recommended as it relies on an incomplete [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/class_b_rep_offset_a_p_i___make_thick_solid.html#af78f35025a31e2ce8bd96c82fb33a981 OpenCASCADE method].
* {{MenuCommand|Make thickness inwards}}: When checked, faces are offset inward.

== Notes ==

* If thickness goes inwards, the value must be smaller than the smallest height of the Body.
* The tool may fail with complex shapes. [[PartDesign_AdditivePipe|Additive Pipe]] or [[PartDesign_AdditiveLoft|Additive Loft]] may work better to create complex shapes.
* Known errors:
** BRep_API: command not done.
** BRep_Tool: no parameter on edge.
** Silently fails.

== Properties ==

A PartDesign Thickness object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

===Data===

{{Properties_Title|Base}}

* {{PropertyData|Base|LinkSub}}: Sub-link to the parent feature's list of selected edges and faces.
* {{PropertyData|Support Transform|Bool}}: Include the base additive/subtractive shape when used in pattern features. If disabled, only the dressed part of the shape is used for patterning. Default: {{FALSE}}.
* {{PropertyData|Add Sub Shape|PartShape|hidden}}
* {{PropertyData|Base Feature|Link|hidden}}: Link to the parent feature.
* {{PropertyData|_ Body|LinkHidden|hidden}}: Link to the parent body.

{{Properties_Title|Part Design}}

* {{PropertyData|Refine|Bool}}: Refine shape (clean up redundant edges) after adding/subtracting. The default value is determined by the {{MenuCommand|Automatically refine model after sketch-based operation}} preference. See [[PartDesign_Preferences#General|PartDesign Preferences]].

{{Properties_Title|Thickness}}

* {{PropertyData|Value|Length}}: Thickness value. Default: {{value|1 mm}}.
* {{PropertyData|Mode|Enumeration}}: Mode. {{value|Skin}} (default), {{value|Pipe}} or {{Value|Recto verso}}. Only {{value|Skin}} is implemented.
* {{PropertyData|Join|Enumeration}}: Join type. {{value|Arc}} (default) or {{Value|Intersection}}.
* {{PropertyData|Reversed|Bool}}: Apply the thickness towards the solids interior. Default: {{FALSE}}.
* {{PropertyData|Intersection|Bool}}: Enable intersection-handling. Default: {{FALSE}}.
