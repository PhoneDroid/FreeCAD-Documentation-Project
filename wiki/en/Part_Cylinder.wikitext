==Description==

The [[Image:Part_Cylinder.svg|24px]] '''Part Cylinder''' command creates a parametric cylinder solid. It is the result of extruding a circular arc along a straight path. In the coordinate system defined by its {{PropertyData|Placement}} property, the bottom face of the cylinder lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin.

A Part Cylinder can be turned into a segment of a cylinder by changing its {{PropertyData|Angle}} property.

[[Image:Part_Cylinder_Example.png|400px]]

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Cylinder.svg|16px]] [[Part_Cylinder|Cylinder]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → Primitives → [[Image:Part_Cylinder.svg|16px]] Cylinder}} option from the menu.
# The '''Cylinder''' object is created.
# Optionally change the dimensions and {{PropertyData|Placement}} of the cylinder by doing one of the following:
#* Double-click the object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]:
#*# The {{MenuCommand|Geometric Primitives}}  [[Task_panel|task panel]] opens.
#*# Change one or more properties.
#*# The object is dynamically updated in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
#*# Press the {{Button|OK}} button to close the task panel.
#* Change the properties in the [[Property_editor|Property editor]].
#* Change the {{PropertyData|Placement}} with the [[Image:Std_TransformManip.svg|16px]] [[Std_TransformManip|Std TransformManip]] command.

== Example ==

[[Image:Part_Cylinder_Scripting_Example.png|thumb|Part Cylinder from the scripting example]]

A Part Cylinder object created with the [[#Scripting|scripting example]] below is shown here.

== Notes ==

* A Part Cylinder can also be created with the [[Image:Part_Primitives.svg|16px]] [[Part_Primitives|Part Primitives]] command. With that command you can specify the dimensions and placement at creation time.

== Properties ==

See also: [[Property_editor|Property editor]].

A Part Cylinder object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [[Part_Part2DObject#Data|Part Part2DObject]].

{{TitleProperty|Cylinder}}

* {{PropertyData|Radius|Length}}: The radius of the circular arc that defines the cylinder. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.
* {{PropertyData|Height|Length}}: The height of the cylinder. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.
* {{PropertyData|Angle|Angle}}: The angle of the circular arc that defines the cylinder. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt; value &lt;&#61; 360°}}. The default is {{Value|360°}}. If it is smaller than {{Value|360°}} the resulting solid will be a segment of a cylinder.

{{TitleProperty|Prism}}

* {{PropertyData|First Angle|Angle}}: The angle between the extrusion direction of the cylinder and its positive Z axis, measured around its Y axis. The angle is positive towards its positive X axis. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. The default is {{Value|0°}}. {{Version|0.20}}
* {{PropertyData|Second Angle|Angle}}: The angle between the extrusion direction of the cylinder and its positive Z axis, measured around its X axis. The angle is positive towards its positive Y axis. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. The default is {{Value|0°}}. {{Version|0.20}}

== Scripting ==

A Part Cylinder can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:

{{Code|code=
cylinder = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Cylinder", "myCylinder")
}}

* Where {{Incode|"myCylinder"}} is the name for the object.
* The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

cylinder = doc.addObject("Part::Cylinder", "myCylinder")
cylinder.Radius = 10
cylinder.Height = 50
cylinder.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(5, 10, 15), App.Rotation(75, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()
}}
