== Description == 

A [[Image:Part_Prism.svg|24px]] '''Part Prism''' is a parametric solid that can be created with the [[Image:Part_Primitives.svg|24px]] [[Part_Primitives|Part Primitives]] command. It is the result of extruding a regular polygon along a straight path. In the coordinate system defined by its {{PropertyData|Placement}} property, the bottom face of the prism lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin and one of its vertices on the X axis.

== Usage == 

See [[Part_Primitives#Usage|Part Primitives]].

== Example ==

[[Image:Part_Prism_Scripting_Example.png|thumb|Part Prism from the scripting example]]

A Part Prism object created with the [[#Scripting|scripting example]] below is shown here.

== Properties ==

See also: [[Property_editor|Property editor]].

A Part Prism object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [[Part_Part2DObject#Data|Part Part2DObject]].

{{TitleProperty|Prism}}

* {{PropertyData|Polygon|IntegerConstraint}}: The number of sides of the polygon. The default is {{Value|6}}.
* {{PropertyData|Circumradius|Length}}: The radius of the circle that circumscribes the polygon, the distance from the center of the polygon to one of its vertices. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.
* {{PropertyData|Height|Length}}: The height of the prism. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.
* {{PropertyData|First Angle|Angle}}: The angle between the extrusion direction of the prism and its positive Z axis, measured around its Y axis. The angle is positive towards its positive X axis. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. The default is {{Value|0°}}.
* {{PropertyData|Second Angle|Angle}}: The angle between the extrusion direction of the prism and its positive Z axis, measured around its X axis. The angle is positive towards its positive Y axis. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. The default is {{Value|0°}}.

== Scripting ==

See also: [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ Autogenerated API documentation], [[Part_scripting|Part scripting]] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

A Part Prism can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:

{{Code|code=
prism = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Prism", "myPrism")
}}

* Where {{Incode|"myPrism"}} is the name for the object.
* The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

prism = doc.addObject("Part::Prism", "myPrism")
prism.Polygon = 5
prism.Circumradius = 10
prism.Height = 50
prism.FirstAngle = 22.5
prism.SecondAngle = 45
prism.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(60, 75, 30))

doc.recompute()
}}
