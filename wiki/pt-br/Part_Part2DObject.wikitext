A [[Part_Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]], or formally a {{incode|Part::Part2DObject}}, is a simple element with a [[Part_TopoShape|topological shape]] that can be displayed in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

The {{incode|Part::Part2DObject}} is derived from the [[Part Feature|Part Feature]], but is specialized for 2D geometry, given that its shape will lie on a plane. This plane is defined by its {{PropertyData|Placement}} property (position, normal, and rotation). However, the plane can also be defined by supporting geometrical elements, such as the plane created by three arbitrary vertices, or a face of a solid body.

==Usage==

The [[Part Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]] is an internal object, so it cannot be created from the graphical interface, only from the [[Python console|Python console]] as described in the [[#Scripting|Scripting]] section.

The {{incode|Part::Part2DObject}} is defined in the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] but can be used as the base class for [[Scripted_objects|scripted objects]] in all [[Workbenches|workbenches]] that produce 2D geometrical shapes. For example, it is the base object for sketches ([[Sketcher_SketchObject|Sketcher SketchObject]]), and for most objects created with the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]].

Workbenches can add more properties to this basic element to produce an object with complex behavior.

== Properties ==

See [[Property|Property]] for all property types that scripted objects can have.

The [[Part_Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]] ({{incode|Part::Part2DObject}} class) is derived from the [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class) and inherits all its properties.

The Part Part2DObject also has the following additional properties in the [[Property_editor|property editor]]. Hidden properties can be shown by using the {{MenuCommand|Show hidden}} command in the context menu of the [[Property_editor|property editor]].

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

* {{PropertyData|Attacher Type|String|Hidden, ReadOnly}}: class name of the attach engine object driving the attachment.
* {{PropertyData|Attacher Engine|Enumeration}}: attach engine object driving the attachment.
* {{PropertyData|Attachment Support|LinkSubList}}: the other (sub)objects supporting this object. It defaults to an empty list {{incode|[]}}.
* {{PropertyData|Map Mode|Enumeration}}: mode of attachment to the other (sub)objects. See [[Part_EditAttachment|Part EditAttachment]].
* {{PropertyData|Map Reversed|Bool}}: if true the Z direction will be reversed. For example, a [[sketch|sketch]] will be flipped upside down. Hidden if {{PropertyData|Map Mode}} is {{value|Deactivated}}.
* {{PropertyData|Map Path Parameter|Float}}: sets the point of curve to map this object to. It goes from {{value|0}} to {{value|1}}, which corresponds to the {{value|start}} and {{value|end}}. It defaults to {{value|0}}. Hidden if not applicable.
* {{PropertyData|Attachment Offset|Placement}}: extra placement to apply in addition to attachment (in local coordinates). Hidden if {{PropertyData|Map Mode}} is {{value|Deactivated}}.

=== View ===

{{TitleProperty|Display Options}}

* {{PropertyView|Show Plane|Bool}}: if true a plane indicating the XY plane of the {{PropertyData|Placement}} of the object is shown. {{Version|1.1}}

== Scripting ==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]] and [[Scripted_objects|scripted objects]].

See [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] for the general information on adding objects to the document.

A Part2DObject is created with the {{incode|addObject()}} method of the document.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Part2DObject", "Name")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}

For [[Python|Python]] subclassing you should create a {{incode|Part::Part2DObjectPython}} object.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Part2DObjectPython", "Name")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}
