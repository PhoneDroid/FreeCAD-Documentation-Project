== Multithreading in FreeCAD ==

* Some 3rd party libraries do some multi-threading like the CAD kernel OCC for boolean operations or the tessellation to create a display mesh from the model. 
* The Eigen3 library which is heavily used for the Sketcher also supports multi-threading. ([https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=37327&p=317539#p317535 source])
