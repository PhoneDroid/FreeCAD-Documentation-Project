An [[App_Link|App Link]], or formally an {{incode|App::Link}}, is a type of object that references or links to another object, in the same document, or in another document. It is especially designed to efficiently duplicate a single object multiple times, which helps with the creation of complex [[assembly|assemblies]] from smaller subassemblies, and from multiple reusable components like screws, nuts, and similar fasteners.
