==Description==

The [[Image:Part_Thickness.svg|24px]] [[Part_Thickness|Thickness]] tool works on a solid shape and transforms it into a hollow object, giving to each of its faces a defined and constant thickness. On some solids it allows you to significantly speed up the work, and avoids making extrusions and pockets.

{{Caption|Hollowed out half of a sphere}}

==Usage== 

# Create a solid
# Select one or more faces
# Click on the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Thickness.svg|16px]] '''Part Thickness'''}} tool
# Set the parameters (see [[#Options|Options]])
# Click {{Button|OK}} to confirm, create the operation and exit the function
# In the Properties table adjust the parameters if necessary

==Options== 

* {{MenuCommand|Thickness}}: Wall thickness of the resulting object, set the desired value.
** A positive value will offset the faces outward
** A negative value will offset the faces inward
* {{MenuCommand|Mode}}
** {{MenuCommand|Skin}}: Only this mode is currently implemented in OCC.
** {{MenuCommand|Pipe}}: This mode has no effect as it's currently not implemented in OCC.
** {{MenuCommand|Recto Verso}}: This mode has no effect as it's currently not implemented in OCC.
* {{MenuCommand|Join Type}}
** {{MenuCommand|Arc}}: Removes the outer edges and creates a fillet with a radius equal to the thickness defined.
** {{MenuCommand|Tangent}}: Results in sharp corners.
** {{MenuCommand|Intersection}}: Results in sharp corners.
* {{MenuCommand|Intersection}}: When enabled, self-intersections in some models are avoided.
* {{MenuCommand|Self-intersection}}: This option is currently not implemented in OCC and should be left with the default value (false).
* {{Button|Faces}}: Select the faces to be removed, then click {{Button|Done}}.
* {{MenuCommand|Update view}}: Automatically updates the view in real time.

==Notes==

* [[App_Link|App Link]] objects linked to the appropriate object types can also be used as source objects. {{Version|0.20}}
* Complex shapes may produce bizarre, hard to predict results. Carefully inspect the resulting shape and save your work before applying the operation.
* As noted in the [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/class_b_rep_offset_a_p_i___make_thick_solid.html#af78f35025a31e2ce8bd96c82fb33a981 OCC documentation] and mentioned in the [[#Options|Options]] section, some options are not implemented yet.

A good example on how to use this tool on the forum: [http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3766&p=29741&hilit=enclosure#p29547 Re: Help designing a simple enclosure]

==Examples==

===Hollow cylinder===

# Create {{Button|[[Image:Part_Cylinder.svg|16px]] [[Part_Cylinder|Cylinder]]}} with radius 10mm and height 20mm
# Select the top and bottom surface of the cylinder
# Click on the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Thickness.svg|16px]] Thickness}} button (no need to change default settings) and press {{KEY|OK}}

Notes:
* For this shape, consider using {{Button|[[Image:Part_Tube.svg|16px]] [[Part_Tube|Tube]]}} instead.
* Select the cylinder's top surface only to create a receptacle.
