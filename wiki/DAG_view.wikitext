The [[DAG view|DAG view]] is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph directed acyclic graph] (DAG) that shows the relationships between different objects in the document. It is meant primarily to show how certain objects depend on others in a complex model with many features and references, such as those that can be created with the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].

<!--T:3-->
The DAG view resembles the graph that can be produced from a Git repository and its branches. Together with the standard [[tree view|tree view]] and the [[Std_DependencyGraph|dependency graph]], the DAG view is a tool to inspect the parametric history of objects in a document.

== Example == <!--T:16-->

<!--T:17-->
A simple model will be seen with different views.

== Activating the DAG view == <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
The DAG view was introduced in 0.17 as an experimental feature for power users and developers, so they could troubleshoot complex models; therefore, the DAG view is not available by default.

<!--T:9-->
To use this view use the [[Std DlgParameter|parameter editor]]. Create the following subgroup if it doesn't exist
* {{incode|BaseApp/Preferences/DockWindows/DAGView}}

<!--T:10-->
then add the parameter {{incode|Enabled}} of type {{incode|Boolean}}, and set it to {{TRUE}}.

<!--T:11-->
Restart FreeCAD and activate DAG view: {{MenuCommand|{{StdMenu|[[Std View Menu|View]]}} → Panels → DAG view}}.

<!--T:12-->
In the [[Std DlgParameter|parameter editor]] you can also change some properties in the following subgroup
* {{incode|BaseApp/Preferences/DAGView}}
* FontPointSize - Set size of text font and can help with readability with high DPI displays. Set to 0 for default font size.
* SelectionMode
** 0 - single click selects an item. Ctrl-click to add items to selection. 
** 1 - every click adds/removes item to selection.
* Direction - the order in which items are displayed.
** 1 - child on top, parent under it
** -1 - parent on top, children under it
