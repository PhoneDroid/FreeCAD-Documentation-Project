<!--T:1-->
FreeCAD uses [https://git-scm.com/ Git] to manage its source code. This document is a cursory introduction to [https://www.gitkraken.com/ GitKraken], a graphical user interface to Git. GitKraken is proprietary software that is free to use for non-commercial use; you don't need GitKraken to develop code for FreeCAD but many developers like it, and find it useful to manage their development. FreeCAD doesn't endorse GitKraken but we hope a guide like this one shows users how easy it is to set up the development environment and encourages more people to contribute.

<!--T:34-->
For more information on general Git usage from the command line see [[Source code management|Source code management]], and the online [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 Pro Git] book. To compile FreeCAD see [[Compiling|Compiling]].

== Introduction == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
Git is a powerful revision control system commonly used to track computer code development. Although it is a complex system, you usually only need some background information on how it works, and to know a few terminal commands. A graphical user interface (GUI) eases the learning curve. [https://www.gitkraken.com/ GitKraken] is a proprietary program that is free to use for non-commercial use that runs on the [https://electronjs.org Electron] framework, which means it is cross platform and can be used the same in Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

== Setting up Git development == <!--T:4-->

<!--T:35-->
There are different ways to download GitKraken depending on your operating system. In Linux distributions, sometimes you can get it from the package manager.

<!--T:5-->
<ol> 
  <li>Download GitKraken.</li>
  <li>In your web browser go to: {{URL|https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD}}.<br>

</translate>
[[File:Github-Fork-button.png]]
<translate>

<!--T:45-->
  </li>
  <li>Click the '''Fork''' button. This will clone the {{incode|FreeCAD/FreeCAD}} repository to your own account. In other words the URL to access your fork will be:

</translate>
<pre>
https://github.com/GITHUBUSERNAME/FreeCAD.git
</pre>
<translate>

<!--T:6-->
  </li>
  <li>Open GitKraken, go to {{MenuCommand|File â†’ Clone Repo}}, and enter this address.<br>

</translate>
[[File:GitKraken-Clone-Repo-dialogue.png]]
<translate>

<!--T:7-->
  </li>
  <li>GitKraken will now {{incode|git clone}} your personal repository.

<!--T:36-->
Please read the difference between [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9257533/what-is-the-difference-between-origin-and-upstream-on-github#9257901 origin vs. upstream] remote repository. Essentially, your fork of FreeCAD is the {{incode|origin}} repository, while the official FreeCAD repository is {{incode|upstream}}. You now need to set the upstream accordingly.</li>
  <li>Locate the sidebar in Gitkraken. There is a '''Local''' and '''Remote''' section. Local refers to your local branches. Remote refers to remote repositories and their branches. Lets add the FreeCAD repo as a remote. In the '''Remote''' section click the {{Button|+}} (as illustrated in the image below).<br>

</translate>
[[File:Gitkraken-remote-sidebar.png]]
<translate>

<!--T:46-->
  </li>
  <li>An '''Add Remote''' dialog will open. Click the Github symbol (1). In the '''Github repo''' field (2) find the {{incode|FreeCAD/FreeCAD}} and click on it. In the '''Name''' field, type {{incode|upstream}}. Then click the {{Button|Add Button}}.<br>

</translate>
[[File:Gitkraken-add-remote-dark.png|400px]]
<translate>

<!--T:9-->
  </li>
  <li>The dialog will close and switch back to GitKraken main interface. This time find the '''Local''' section in the sidebar; double click on the {{incode|master}} branch so you switch to it. In the command line, this is equivalent to

</translate>
<pre>
git checkout master
</pre>
<translate>

<!--T:47-->
  </li>
  <li>Click on the '''Push''' icon on the top right side of the interface. This will push your '''Local master''' to your '''Remote origin master'''</li>
</ol>

<!--T:14-->
{{Caption|GitKraken interface showing three local branches including a local {{Emphasis|master}}, and remote {{incode|origin}} and {{incode|upstream}} repositories, each of which have a master and release branches.}}
In the image, the remote the '''Local master''' and '''Remote origin master''' branches are three commits behind the '''Remote upstream master''', that is, the official FreeCAD source code. This is indicated by the icons being three steps behind in the chain that represents the commit history of the master branch. See [[Developing_FreeCAD_with_GitKraken#Rebasing|Rebasing]] to update the branches that are behind.

== Rebasing == <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
* Checkout the '''Local master''' branch by double clicking on it ({{incode|git checkout master}})
* Move the mouse to the last upstream commit, right click, and choose '''Rebase master onto upstream/master''' ({{incode|git pull upstream master}})
* Now press the '''Push''' button ({{incode|git push origin master}}). This pushes from your '''Local master''' to the '''Remote origin master'''.

<!--T:39-->
{{Caption|Rebasing a local master updates it so that it matches the contents of the upstream master.}}

== Branches == <!--T:17-->

<!--T:18-->
Branches are a feature that makes Git powerful compared to other revision systems. Branches aren't complete forks, but rather define snapshots where a version of the code starts diverging from the master branch. Whenever you want to modify the FreeCAD code, first create a branch, then make changes, and then merge your commits back to the master branch. With Git it is simple to create, merge and delete branches when you no longer need them. Please read [https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/branching-and-merging Branching and Merging] to understand more about this process in GitKraken.

<!--T:19-->
# Make sure you currently have the master branch active (double click on it, {{incode|git checkout master}}). In GitKraken the '''Local master''' branch should be highlighted in '''green'''.
# Click the '''Branch''' button to create a new branch and enter its new name ({{incode|git checkout -b new-name-of-your-branch}}).

== Making pull requests == <!--T:20-->

<!--T:21-->
[https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/ Pull requests] (PRs) are necessary to merge the code in a branch in your local repository with the code in the {{incode|upstream}} repository. To summarize the process, once you've modified your branch, you need to push it to your GitHub fork ({{incode|origin}}, {{URLn|https://github.com/GITHUBUSERNAME/FreeCAD.git}}), and from there make a pull request to {{incode|upstream}}. GitKraken saves you some clicks to easily create pull requests instead of using GitHub's interface.

<!--T:23-->
Steps in GitKraken:
* Find you local branch on the interface and make sure it's active (double click on it).
* Right click the branch name and find the option to '''Push <your-branch-name> and start a pull request'''.
:GitKraken will open a dialog that asks you to confirm the repository which your branch will use to pull and push. It will then push your local branch to that remote repository.
</translate>
[[File:Gitkraken-How to PR.png]]
<translate>
<!--T:24-->
* GitKraken will ask you what you want to call the remote branch. The default name is the same name that the branch has locally in your computer.
</translate>
[[File:Gitkraken-How-to-PR-Prompt-for-Branch-name.png|1200px]]
<translate>
<!--T:25-->
* GitKraken then opens up another dialog asking the repositories and branches to merge, and the direction (from and to).
:You normally want to merge from the remote '''origin <your-branch-name>''' ({{incode|GITHUBUSERNAME/FreeCAD}}) to the remote '''upstream master''' branch ({{incode|FreeCAD/FreeCAD}}). Be sure to enter a good title for the pull request, and write a more descriptive paragraph if your changes are significant. Consult the official documentation of [https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/pull-requests GitKraken] for more information.

<translate>

== Resolving merge conflicts == <!--T:27-->

<!--T:28-->
GitKraken has a special merge conflict tool that is only accessible in the GitKraken Pro version. However, there are workarounds to use external tools for merging.
* [https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/branching-and-merging/ GitKraken compatible external merge tools]: Beyond Compare, FileMerge, Kaleidoscope, KDiff, Araxis, P4Merge
* If none of the above options work for you, it's possible to specify [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_external_merge_tools External merge and diff tools] within the configuration file {{incode|~/.gitconfig}} in your user's home directory.

== Squashing commits == <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
As a revision control system Git encourages making many commits to keep track of your changes; however, if you have too many small changes the commit history may look a bit messy. Squashing is condensing various commits into only one commit. From the [https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-commits/squash/ GitKraken manual], squashing is available for commits that meet the following requirements:
* You need to select at least two commits to squash.
* The youngest commit, by commit date, is also the current HEAD commit.
* Genealogically consecutive.
* Chronologically consecutive.
* The oldest commit in the list has a parent.

<!--T:40-->
If all these conditions are met, the '''Squash''' option appears when you right click the commit node. See [https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/working-with-files/commits/squash.gif Squash.gif]

== Following other FreeCAD repositories == <!--T:31-->

<!--T:32-->
You can use GitKraken to follow the personal FreeCAD forks of other developers; in this way you can see how they write code and commit changes to their own branches before they submit pull requests to the upstream {{incode|FreeCAD/FreeCAD}} repository.
# In the left side panel next to the '''Remote''' category, press the '''+''' sign.
# A dialogue will come up to enter the name of the repository that you want to add. Recommended remotes are from the main FreeCAD developers and known contributors: wmayer, yorikvanhavre, ickby, sliptonic, kkremitzki, etc.
# Press '''Add Remote'''.

<!--T:41-->
Now whenever new commits are made, or branches are rebased, by the authors of those repositories, you will see their commit history in a graphical way.
