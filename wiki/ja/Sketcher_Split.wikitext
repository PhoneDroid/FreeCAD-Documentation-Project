== Description == 

The [[Image:Sketcher_Split.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_Split|Sketcher Split]] tool splits an edge. If the edge is a closed curve (i.e. a circle, an ellipse or a periodic B-spline) it is converted to an open curve (an arc, an arc of ellipse or a non-periodic B-spline respectively).

== Usage ==

See also: [[Sketcher_Workbench#Drawing_aids|Drawing aids]].

# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_Split.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_Split|Split edge]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketcher → Sketcher tools → [[Image:Sketcher_Split.svg|16px]] Split edge}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|G}} then {{KEY|Z}}.
# If there is a previous selection it is cleared. The tool does not accept a pre-selection.
# The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
# Click an edge at the point where it should be split.
# If the original edge is a line or an open curve, two new edges are created connected by a [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|Coincident constraint]]. For closed curves a new open curve is created, the new point then does not receive a Coincident constraint. Existing applicable constraints are transferred to the new edge(s). See [[#Notes|Notes]].
# This tool always runs in continue mode: optionally keep splitting edges.
# To finish, click in an empty area in the [[3D_view|3D view]], right-click or press {{KEY|Esc}}, or start another geometry or constraint creation tool.

== Notes == 

* A [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|Coincident]] constraint is applied to the center points of new arcs.
* [[Sketcher_ConstrainRadius|Radius]] and [[Sketcher_ConstrainDiameter|Diameter]] constraints are copied to new arcs (resulting in a redundancy).
* Coincident constraints and [[Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject|Point on object]] constraints are transferred to the closest new edge.
* [[Sketcher_ConstrainHorizontal|Horizontal]] and [[Sketcher_ConstrainVertical|Vertical]] constraints between points are transferred to the closest new edge.
* Horizontal and Vertical constraints attached to lines are copied to new line segments.
* [[Sketcher_ConstrainParallel|Parallel]] and [[Sketcher_ConstrainPerpendicular|Perpendicular]] constraints are copied to new line segments, for new arcs they are only copied to the closest.
* [[Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceX|Horizontal distance]], [[Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceY|Vertical distance]] and [[Sketcher_ConstrainDistance|Distance]] constraints are transferred to the closest new edge.
* [[Sketcher_ConstrainAngle|Angle]], [[Sketcher_ConstrainSymmetric|Symmetric]] and [[Sketcher_ConstrainBlock|Block]] constraints are currently not transferred.
