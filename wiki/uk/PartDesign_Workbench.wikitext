== Introduction ==

The [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|32px]] '''PartDesign Workbench''' provides tools for modeling solid components. It is mostly focused on creating mechanical components that can be manufactured and assembled into a finished product. Nevertheless, the created solids can be used for any other purpose such as [[BIM_Workbench|BIM modeling]], [[FEM_Workbench|finite element analysis]], or [[CAM_Workbench|machining and 3D printing]].

The PartDesign Workbench uses a feature based methodology. A component is represented by the Body object container. The Body defines a local coordinate system and contains the cumulative features that define the component. Most features are based on parametric sketches and are either additive or subtractive. For example, the [[PartDesign_Pad|Pad tool]] adds the extruded sketch to the developing solid, the [[PartDesign_Pocket|Pocket tool]] subtracts the extruded sketch. Each feature is cumulative and builds on the result of preceding features. It is also possible to use primitives ([[PartDesign_AdditiveCylinder|Cylinder]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveSphere|Sphere]], etc.) as well as solids created outside the Body as features.

See the [[Feature_editing|feature editing]] page for a more complete explanation of this process, and then see [[Creating_a_simple_part_with_PartDesign|Creating a simple component with PartDesign]] to get started with creating solids.

The [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|16px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] provides an alternative [[constructive_solid_geometry|constructive solid geometry]] (CSG) methodology for building shapes. For a detailed discussion of the Part Workbench versus the Part Design Workbench see [[Part_and_PartDesign|Part and Part Design]].

== Tools ==
</div>

The Part Design tools are all located in the {{MenuCommand|Part Design}} menu and the PartDesign toolbar that appear when you load the Part Design workbench.

<span id="Structure_tools"></span>
<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
=== Structure tools ===

These are tools to organize the Model tree.

* [[Image:Std_Part.png|32px]] [[Std Part|Part]]: adds a new Part container in the active document and makes it active.
* [[Image:Group.svg|32px]] [[Std Group|Group]]: adds a Group in the active document's Model tree.
</div>

These tools are in fact not part of the PartDesign Workbench. They belong to the [[Std_Base|Std Base]] system. They were developed in v0.17 with the intention that they would be useful to organize a model, and create [[Assembly|assemblies]]; as such, they are very useful when working with bodies created with this workbench.
