{{TOCright}}

[[File:Defeaturing_workbench_icon.svg|24px]] [[Defeaturing Workbench]] is an add-on workbench intended for editing STEP models, removing of the selected features from the model. It is an [[External Workbenches|external workbench]] and therefore not part of the standard FreeCAD install.  

==Features==

* Features a set of tools to edit a Shape or a STEP model, removing hole(s), face(s), simplifying the model, changing the tolerance, applying Fuzzy Boolean operations etc...
* There are also tools to create more solid shape(s), from edge(s), face(s) or shell(s). 
* It is also possible to use direct modeling of the model, when the history of operations is unavailable. (This is the case for 3D STEP models).
* Useful in situations to quickly remove proprietary details of the model before sharing it. See [[Defeaturing|Defeaturing]]

Note: More advance Defeaturing tools can be used if [[OpenCASCADE|OCC7.3]] is available.

==Installation==

===Automatic (recommended) ===

Using the FreeCAD [[Image:AddonManager.svg|24px]] [[Std AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] available in v0.17+ via {{MenuCommand|Tools → Addon Manager}}. Search for the [[File:Defeaturing_workbench_icon.svg|24px]] Defeaturing workbench icon. The Addon Manager also notifies the user when a new version of this Addon is available.

=== Manually ===

See [[How to install additional workbenches]]

=== Supports ===

* FreeCAD v0.15 4671  
* FreeCAD v0.16 >= 6712  
* FreeCAD v0.17 >= 13522

== External workbenches ==

FreeCAD workbenches are easy to program in [[Python|Python]], there are therefore many people developing additional workbenches outside of the FreeCAD main developers.

The [[external workbenches|external workbenches]] page has some information and tutorials on some of them, and the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons FreeCAD Addons] project aims at gathering them and making them easily installable from within FreeCAD.

New workbenches are in development, stay tuned!
