As you may have experienced sometimes, programmers are sometimes bad documentation writers! It is therefore vital that experienced users help to write, update, fix and revise the documentation. Yes, we mean you! Editing the wiki is [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting easy]. As this wiki is write-protected to reduce spamming, you will need a FreeCAD wiki account to log in. Ask [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=6830 on the forum] and we will create an account for you. Currently, the wiki account is separate from the forum account but we will create you a wiki account with the same name as your forum account. Then you can start editing!  Also, check out [https://wiki.freecad.org/index.php?title=Help_FreeCAD this page] for more ways you can help FreeCAD.
