==Add to tutorial: Thread start/end options==
* https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/16488
* Problem: "The PartDesign Helix could have options to modify the Start/End of the thread. I want to have a smooth transition but my attempts using pad, sweep+helix and other methods are failing to produce a working feature."
* Possible solution: "You can make another helix with the end face of the thread and a shifted axis"
