== Overview == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:2-->
The intention of this page is to serve as a guide for users that are accustomed to the SolidWorks CAD/CAM workflow and want to migrate to FreeCAD.

== History == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
Understanding a little of the history of FreeCAD may help users comprehend it better: 
* FreeCAD was initially designed to behave parametrically using the [[Constructive_solid_geometry|Constructive solid geometry]] method (see the [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|24px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]]). 
* Later it incorporated the [[Feature_editing|Feature editing]] method with the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]]. SolidWorks also uses this approach.

== Tips == <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
The [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] has many functions that are equivalent to SolidWorks. The image below identifies equivalent functions and their names on each platform, as well as functions that are unique to each platform.

== Topological naming problem == <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
FreeCAD version 0.20 is still affected by the [[Topological_naming_problem|Topological naming problem]], but there are plans to fix this in the next version.
