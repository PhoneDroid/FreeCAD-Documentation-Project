The [[Image:Curves_ParametricComb.svg|24px]] [[Curves_ParametricComb|Curves ParametricComb]] can help to visualize the regularity or smoothness of a curve as well as the continuity between two curves. Note: A comb is only for visualization.

A 3D comb will be created for 3D curves. Sample and scale can be changed. This tool is part of the [[External_workbenches|external workbench]] called [[Curves_Workbench|Curves]].
