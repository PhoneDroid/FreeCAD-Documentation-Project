I would say point 10. should be marked as an optional curiosity check. 

The real deal would be further explanation how to work efficiently with PCB and possible changes done to it in Kicad (not just moving components a bit). For example, KicadStepUP doesn't support pulling new parts into the existing document, so there has to be a workflow (workaround) to mitigate this limitation. 
I found that the best way to deal with that is to Load the PCB into Freecad and save it as a separate file - this file will always be updated by Loading PCB and overwriting this file with Ctrl+S. Then, in a another document, one can create parts around the PCB (e.g 3D printed case). The PCB model+components can be linked using Make Link tool (and then alt + drag) into our that project document. Linked models (the PCB with components) can be then easily reoriented to fit the plastic case. Alternatively, the Assembly4 can be used which improve logical flow of the document. However I don't know if joints would work after reloading and overwriting PCB document - haven't tried - I only used Transform tool as well.
