== Core system and API == <!--T:10-->

=== Core === <!--T:11-->

<!--T:64-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Core_datums_relnotes_1.1.png|384px]]
| [[Std_Base#Part_Datums|Core Datum tools]] were implemented to create coordinate systems, datum planes, datum lines and datum points which can be attached and also used in Assembly.
[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18332 Pull request #18332]

{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Std_Transform_Manip_relnotes_1.1.gif|384px]]</br>Click on the image if the animation does not start.
| The [[Std TransformManip|Transform]] tool was overhauled and now allows for precise inputs besides dragging in the 3D view. It is possible to align the interactive dragger to any element in the document and to transform the object in that local (U, V, W) coordinate system of the dragger, or in the global document coordinate system. The dragger can be aligned to the object's origin as before, and also to the center of mass of the object. It has a new feature to move the object (at the location of the dragger) to a target location in the document and flip the orientation. See all [[Std_TransformManip#Options|new options]].

== PartDesign Workbench == <!--T:36-->

=== Further PartDesign improvements === <!--T:37-->

<!--T:68-->
* The origin feature in a PartDesign body makes use of the new core datums. The appearance has been changed and the planes enlarge when creating a new sketch. As the orientation was wrong in older FreeCAD versions, files created with these versions need to be converted on opening. It can break files which reference the datums, and converted or new files created with {{VersionPlus|1.1}} will be broken in {{VersionMinus|1.0}}. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18126 Pull request #18126]
