{{VeryImportantMessage|This project was realized during [[#GSOC 2019|GSOC 2019]]}}

This page is dedicated  to the description of the [[Google Summer of Code|Google Summer of Code 2019]] project idea of adding BCF support to FreeCAD.

== Outline ==

[https://www.buildingsmart.org/bim-collaboration-format-explained/ BIM Collaboration Format] (or BCF) is a file format aimed at coordinating the work of several participants in a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling Building Information Modeling (BIM)] project. The format specifications are [http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/bcf-releases maintained by BuildingSMART], the same consortium behind the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes IFC] file format.

The BCF format implements a series of tools to allow users to create, annotate, classify, comment, discuss and solve issues on a BIM model. It works as a thin layer containing issues related to a BIM model. The BCF file itself doesn't contain or relate explicitly to the model, which allow different people who work on a same project but with different applications to still be able to discuss and process the same issues.

This project idea proposes to implement a BCF viewer for FreeCAD. The viewer would allow to:

* Open BCF files
* View the different issues with their comments and images (screenshots)
* Navigate in a FreeCAD model to a camera position stored in the BCF file
* Comment, annotate, classify and tag issues
* Create new issues, save screenshots and camera position
* Save BCF files
* If time permits, explore the possibilities of server-based BCF serving (API)

== Details ==

* Get familiar with FreeCAD and the current state of BIM tools
* Get familiar with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PySide PySide] and Qt
* Get familiar with the BCF format, gather a series of test files
* Implement the different functions needed to interact with BCF files and data
* Implement a Graphical User Interface to these functions

== Expected Outcome ==

* Documentation. Like all open-source projects, it is of uttermost importance to document a lot everything you do. This allows for other people to take on and extend your work more easily.
* A complete, working GUI application, that works as a plugin/addon inside FreeCAD.

== Future Possibilities ==

BCF use in the BIM industry is still at its infancy. One can think of many possible extensions, such as:

* Connecting with other (open-source) communication structures: forums, chat/messaging systems, etc...
* Connecting with other issues tracking systems

== Project Properties ==
