==Beschreibung==

The [[Image:CAM_Profile.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Profile|Profile]] tool creates a contour operation based on selected features of the model. The tool was introduced in version 0.19. It offers three operations that were handled by separate tools in previous versions.

All operations create objects that are made to be part of a {{KEY|[[Image:CAM_Job.svg|24px]] [[CAM_Job|CAM Job]]}}.

These are the available operations:

<span id="Contour_operation"></span>
===Konturbearbeitung===

A {{KEY|Contour}} operation is the default. It creates a simple external contour cut of complex 3D [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|24px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part]]-based objects. The entire Job Model serves as the input for the Operation, regardless of whether any Body Geometry is selected when the Contour command is invoked.

<span id="Profile_Face_operation"></span>
===Profilflächenbearbeitung===

A {{KEY|Profile Face}} operation creates a simple contour path from one or more selected faces of an object.

<span id="Profile_Edges_operation"></span>
===Profilkantenbearbeitung===

A {{KEY|Profile Edges}} operation creates a simple contour path from selected edges.

<span id="Usage"></span>
==Anwendung==

# There are several ways to invoke the command: 
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:CAM_Profile.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Profile|CAM Profile]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|CAM → [[Image:CAM_Profile.svg|16px]] Profile}} option from the menu.
# Activate the Base Geometry section by clicking its tab, and select features from the Job model. 
#* If no features are selected, the command defaults to a {{MenuCommand|Contour}} operation, contouring the entire model.
#* If faces are selected, then the result is a {{MenuCommand|Profile Face}} operation.
#* If edges are selected, then the result is a {{MenuCommand|Profile Edges}} operation.<br>'''NOTE''': This operation has received improvements to allow functionality on some open-edge (non-loop) selections.  See the [[#Usage_Notes|Usage Notes]] section below for additional information on best practice for profiling open-edges.
# Activate the Operation section by clicking on its tab, and adjust the operation's settings as desired.
# Optionally press the {{Button|Apply}} button to preview the operation with the current settings.
# Click the {{Button|OK}} button or the {{Button|Cancel}} button to create or cancel the operation.

'''Important Note: CAM Profile doesn't take care of other details of the object. You have to adjust the properties, especially the final depth, carefully, a mistake might destroy your work piece'''

A Start point can be enabled from the Operation tab in the Tasks Window editor, using a location defined in the {{MenuCommand|Property View → Data → Start Point}}.

Make additional adjustments to the operation by modifying the operation's properties in the Data tab of the Property View. Advanced properties will be located here, if any.

==Usage Notes==

* The {{KEY|[[Image:CAM_Profile.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Profile|Profile]]}} operation is capable of profiling '''open-edges''' (one or more continuous edges that do not form a loop as seen from the ''Top View'')
** It is best to select the top edges (highest edges) for the selection. After doing so, you will need to manually set the Final Depth for the operation. Selection of bottom edges only is unpredictable and will likely return undesirable paths in many situations; however, it will return correct paths in some situations.
** Selected edges must form a continual edge ''as viewed from the Top View''.  Selected top edges may have differing heights, so long as they connect at a common (X, Y) coordinate - differing Z-heights are acceptable in ''some'''**''''' cases.  <BR />'''**'''In certain cases, the user will need to include in their selection the straight vertical connecting edge between two adjacent edges of different heights that share a common (X, Y) coordinate.
**Because top edges are selected, the Final Depth for the operation will need to be set manually.
** When profiling open-edges, the `Side` or `Cut Side` property is disabled internally even though it will likely be visible within the Task editor window and the Properties list within the Data tab.
* When profiling the entire model (a complete contour of the model) the `Side` or `Cut Side` property is set to `Outside` by default. User can adjust it depending on the configuration of the part.

<span id="Properties"></span>
==Eigenschaften==

''' ''Note'' ''': Not all of these Properties are available in the Task Window Editor. Some are only accessible in the Data tab of the Properties View panel for this Operation.

{{TitleProperty|Base}} 

Note: It is suggested that you do not edit the Placement property of path operations. Rather, move or rotate the CAM Job model as needed.

* {{PropertyData|Placement}}: Overall placement[position and rotation] of the object - with respect to the origin (or origin of parent object container)
** {{PropertyData|Angle}}: Angle in degrees applied to rotation of the object around Axis property value
** {{PropertyData|Axis}}:  Axis(one or multiple) around which to rotate the object, set in sub-properties: x, y, z
*** {{PropertyData|X}}: x axis value
*** {{PropertyData|Y}}: y axis value
*** {{PropertyData|Z}}: z axis value
** {{PropertyData|Position}}: Position of the object, set in sub-properties: x, y, z - with respect to the origin (or origin of parent object container)
*** {{PropertyData|X}}: x distance value
*** {{PropertyData|Y}}: y distance value
*** {{PropertyData|Z}}: z distance value
* {{PropertyData|Label}}: User-provided name of the object (UTF-8)

{{TitleProperty|Depth}}

* {{PropertyData|Clearance Height}}: The height needed to clear clamps and obstructions
* {{PropertyData|Final Depth}}: Final Depth of Tool- lowest value in Z. User must define it.
* {{PropertyData|Finish Depth}}: Maximum material removed on final pass. The height (thickness) of the last cutting level - ''set for a better finish''.
* {{PropertyData|Safe Height}}: The height above which Rapid motions are allowed. (Rapid safety height between locations)
* {{PropertyData|Start Depth}}: Starting depth of Tool - ''first cut depth in Z''. User must define it.
* {{PropertyData|Step Down}}: Incremental step down of Tool during operation
