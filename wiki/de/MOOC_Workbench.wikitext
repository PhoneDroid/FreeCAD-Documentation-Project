== Overview==

{{TOCright}}

The MOOC Workbench is an [[External_workbenches|external workbench]] with which you can follow interactive tutorials and make evaluation of your work directly within the FreeCAD interface. The MOOC workbench offers 2 tools: interactive tutorials and evaluations.

* Currently only in French (and hard-coded).
* Only compatible with FreeCAD Py3 and Qt5 (PySide2)
* LGPLv2 (or similar) code funded by Europe through IMT and EESAB.
* Modular: This workbench was created with the intention that the addition of tutorials and evaluations was modular. In other words, one has to add a tutorial in the {{FileName|lessons}} folder or an evaluation in the {{FileName|exercises}} folder to show up in the respective tool.

=== Interactive ===
'''Interactive''' tutorials (AKA [[Image:MOOC_Player.svg|24px]] Player) are step-by-step guided exercises with objective checks. It launches directly into FreeCAD and allows you to advance one step at a time of modeling of an object. The user has a text, a video and above all a check that the objectives have been achieved.

=== Evaluations ===
'''Evaluations''' (AKA [[Image:MOOC_Grader.svg|24px]] Grader) consist of a small program that checks certain criteria of a FreeCAD document, for example, the presence of a part body, a sketch or the final volume.

==Installation== 

This workbench can be installed from the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. For manual installation see [[Installing_more_workbenches|Installing more workbenches]].

==Limitations==

ATM this workbench is only available in the French language. 

==Technical Details==

From a technical point of view, the workbench is composed of:
* an "API" that contains the code that analyzes the document ({{FileName|MoocChecker.py}})
* the code that executes the tutorials in the "lessons" folder ({{FileName|MoocPlayer.py}})
* the code that executes the evaluations in the "exercises" folder ({{FileName|MoocGrader.py}})

==Roadmap==
* internationalization of the workbench
* Integration of videos in FreeCAD (PySide2.QtWebEngineWidgets?)
* <s>request the integration of the workbench in the list of the addon manager</s> DONE

== External workbenches == 

FreeCAD workbenches are easy to program in [[Python|Python]], there are therefore many people developing additional workbenches outside of the FreeCAD main developers.

The [[external workbenches|external workbenches]] page has some information and tutorials on some of them, and the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons FreeCAD Addons] project aims at gathering them and making them easily installable from within FreeCAD.

New workbenches are in development, stay tuned!
