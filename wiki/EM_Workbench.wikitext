== Introduction ==

The EM (ElectroMagnetic) Workbench provides the CAD front-end interface to some open source free solvers. At present it supports the 3D magnetoquasistatic impedance solver [https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/software.htm#fasthenry2 FastHenry] (i.e. inductance and resistance extraction at "low" frequencies). Support for the 3D electrostatic capacitance solver [https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/software.htm#fastercap FasterCap] is ongoing.

== Installation ==

The [[EM_Workbench|EM Workbench]] is an [[External_workbenches|external workbench]], that can be installed from the FreeCAD [[Image:AddonManager.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. This can be done via the {{MenuCommand|Tools â†’ Addon Manager}} menu.

The electromagnetic solvers FastHenry2 and FasterCap must be installed separately. Their binary codes as well as the sources are freely available from [https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com FastFieldSolvers].

== Usage ==

=== FastHenry ===

FastHenry is a software for computing the frequency-dependant self and mutual inductances and resistances of a generic tridimensional conductive structure, in the magnetoquasistatic approximation. It can also generate Spice-compatible, multiple-frequency equivalent-circuit models.

Knowledge of FastHenry is a pre-condition for the proficient usage of the ElectroMagnetic Workbench for FastHenry. We suggest you to read the original [https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/documentation.htm FastHenry User's manual] and play a bit with the sample files that are provided with the installation.

=== FasterCap ===

FasterCap is a powerful three- and two-dimensional capacitance extraction program. 

Knowledge of FasterCap is a pre-condition for the proficient usage of the ElectroMagnetic Workbench for FasterCap. We suggest you to read the original [https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/documentation.htm FasterCap help file] and play a bit with the sample files that are provided with the installation.

== FasterCap Tools ==

At present, FasterCap is supported via some Macros in the {{FileName|Export_mesh.py}} file available in the [https://github.com/ediloren/EM-Workbench-for-FreeCAD ElectroMagnetic Workbench GitHub source code].

== API ==

The EM tools can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the EM API.
