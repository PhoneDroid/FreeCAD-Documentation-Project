== Introduction ==

An [[App_OriginGroupExtension|App Origin]] object, or formally an {{incode|App::OriginGroupExtension}}, is a class supplying selectable elements that represent the three standard axes (X, Y, Z) and three standard planes (XY, XZ and YZ) to objects that are intended to arrange different types of geometry in space.

[[Image:Std_Part.svg|16px]] [[Std_Part|Std Part]] [[App_Part|(App Part)]] objects and 
[[Image:PartDesign_Body.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]] objects are created with Origin objects by default. If needed, Origin objects can be added to [[Image:Assembly_Assembly_Tree.svg|16px]] [[Assembly3_CreateAssembly|Assembly]] objects of the [[Image:Assembly3_workbench_icon.svg|16px]] [[Assembly3_Workbench|Assembly3]] workbench, too.

The axes and planes are objects of type {{incode|App::Line}} and {{incode|App::Plane}} respectively. Each of these elements can be hidden and unhidden individually with the {{KEY|Space}} bar. This can be useful when selecting the correct reference for creating other objects e.g. [[Sketch|Sketches]].
