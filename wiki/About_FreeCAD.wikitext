'''FreeCAD''' is a general purpose [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source open source] parametric 3D [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAD '''CAD'''] modeler licensed under the [[License|LGPL License]]. FreeCAD is aimed directly at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering mechanical engineering] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design product design] but, being very generic, also fits in a wider range of uses around engineering, such as architecture, finite element analysis, 3D printing, and other tasks.

<!--T:5-->
FreeCAD features tools similar to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA CATIA], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidworks SolidWorks], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_Edge Solid Edge] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Revit Revit], and therefore also falls into the category of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAD '''CAD'''], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Lifecycle_Management '''PLM'''], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAx '''CAx'''], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering '''CAE'''] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling '''BIM''']. It is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_feature_based_modeler feature based parametric modeler] with a modular software architecture making it possible to provide additional functionality without modifying the core system.

<!--T:6-->
As with other CAD modelers it has many 2D components in order to sketch planar shapes or create production drawings. However, direct 2D drawing (like [https://inkscape.org/ Inkscape] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD#AutoCAD_LT AutoCAD LT]) is not the focus, neither are animation or mesh editing (like [https://www.blender.org/ Blender], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(software) Maya], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max Autodesk 3ds Max], or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINEMA_4D Cinema 4D]). Nevertheless, thanks to its wide adaptability, FreeCAD is useful in a much broader area around its base feature set.

<!--T:7-->
FreeCAD makes heavy use of open-source libraries that exist in the field of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Computation scientific computing]. Among them are [http://OpenCascade.org Open Cascade Technology (OCCT)], a powerful CAD kernel; [https://github.com/coin3d/coin/wiki Coin3D], a toolkit for 3D graphics development compatible with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Inventor Open Inventor]; [http://www.qt.io/ Qt], the world-famous user interface framework; and [http://www.python.org Python], a modern scripting language. FreeCAD itself can also be used as a library by other programs.

<!--T:8-->
FreeCAD is also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform multi-platform], and currently runs on Linux/Unix, Windows, and macOS systems with the same look and functionality on all platforms.

===About the FreeCAD project=== <!--T:10-->

<!--T:12-->
The FreeCAD project was started as far back as 2001, as described on the [[History|history]] page. 

<!--T:11-->
FreeCAD is maintained and developed by a [[contributors|community of enthusiastic developers and users]] and is built through the patient work of hundreds of contributors, some regular, some occasional. Most work on FreeCAD as volunteers. The [http://forum.freecad.org FreeCAD forum] is where most of the ideas and decisions are discussed, and the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD GitHub repository] is where the code is being kept, shared, discussed and worked on. Anybody is [[Help FreeCAD|welcome to participate]].

=== About the FPA === <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
The FreeCAD project is also supported by a non-profit organization, the [https://fpa.freecad.org FreeCAD project association (FPA)]. The FPA is an independent body created by some FreeCAD veterans in 2021 to collect [[donate|donations]] and other resources to support the project and its community, to help protect that community and allow it to continue developing in the best conditions, and to represent the project against other bodies such as companies and institutions.
