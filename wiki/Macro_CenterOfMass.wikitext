==Usage== <!--T:4-->

<!--T:9-->
# Select one or more solids.
# Launch the macro.
# You'll have a window listing the solids. You can specify the density of your material in different unit systems or choose from predefined materials.

===Available Options=== <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
* Color the solids according to density.
* Display the location of the center of mass.
* Export and import ''masses'', ''materials'' and ''densities'' (even if it's not a {{FileName|.csv}} file from the macro, but columns must be named accordingly).
* Save densities in the document (remove them again when setting material to {{ComboBox|default}}).
* You can change some preferences at {{MenuCommand|Tools → Edit parameters → Preferences → Macros}}.

==Script== <!--T:11-->

Version / Date of merge

<!--T:40-->
0.8.4 / 2025-06-10:
* Fix: [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros/pull/197 Fix macro ceased to work with Qt6 (PR#197)]

<!--T:39-->

* New: Show Volume and Surface area
* New: Calculate Moments of Inertia
* Fix: Macro now works with the Assembly example in FreeCAD 1.0
* Fix: Automatically select material for solids if it is already assigned by the new material system
* Minor UI changes

<!--T:37-->
0.7.6 / 2024-08-01: Prepare for major FreeCAD release
* Fix: Make 0.22.0dev AssemblyExample work

* New: Show mass of each solid.
* New: Start window docked or floating (can be set in Parameter Editor).
* New: Selection matches up tree view or is sorted by name (can be set in Parameter Editor).
