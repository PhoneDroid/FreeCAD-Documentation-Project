== Introduction == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
OSH Automated Documentation is software that allows you to generate high-quality visual assembly instructions for physical products designed in CAD software. It consists of two parts, this FreeCAD workbench and a compiler for generating PDF files. For more information see the [https://osh-autodoc.org OSH Automated Documentation website]. This page mainly discusses the workbench that is available in the FreeCAD Addon Manager.

== Overview == <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
This software originates from a [https://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.56 peer-reviewed article] and as such still research software and not production ready. By popular demand we are actively searching for funding to continue this work and make it production ready.

== Usage == <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
The software consists of a '''workbench''' and a '''compiler''' that generates a PDF based on a textual description of the manual. The workbench is used to make annotations to the CAD model, for example a STEP file. An example of such an annotation is in the figure below where the camera position is saved to for generating a high-quality image for in the manual:

<!--T:8-->
The workbench generates a directory structure with SVG images and a BOM of the parts used for an assembly step. The BOM is a CSV file with images for each part. This output can be used by other software, and in particular or compiler uses it to create PDF images.

<!--T:9-->
The interface between our compiler and workbench has been designed such that the output of the workbench can be used for other workflows as well.
