== Introduction ==

The Render Workbench let's you produce high-quality images from FreeCAD models, using open-source external rendering engines.

A pure Python workbench, Render is seamlessly integrated in FreeCAD: the whole rendering scene - objects, lighting, materials, camera, etc. - can be described with FreeCAD objects, to be exported to external renderers.

Compared with other approaches based on third-part computer graphics applications, Render aims to:
* Avoid the user to learn another 3D/computer graphics software: everything you need to know is in FreeCAD.
* Simplify rendering workflow and relieve user from any intermediate file manipulation - like import, export, scene retouching etc.
* Make scene configuration persistent and especially prevent rework in an external tool each time the model has been modified.

== Supported renderers ==

At the moment six rendering engines are supported:
* LuxCoreRender
* Appleseed
* Cycles (standalone version)
* Pov-Ray
* Intel Ospray Studio
* Pbrt-v4 (experimental)

== Usage ==

In quick-start mode, after workbench installation has correctly been done, rendering a FreeCAD model is just a 4-step process:

# '''Create a rendering project:''' Press the button in the toolbar corresponding to your renderer and select a template suitable for your renderer (you may start with a 'studio' flavour, like {{FileName|appleseed_studio_light.appleseed}}, {{FileName|cycles_studio_light.xml}}, {{FileName|luxcore_studio_light.cfg}}, {{FileName|povray_studio_light.pov}} etc.).
# '''Add views of your objects to your rendering project:''' Select both the objects and the project, and press the {{Button|Add view}} button.
# '''Set your point of view:''' [[Manual:Navigating_in_the_3D_view|Navigate in the 3D View]] to the desired position and switch to [[Std_PerspectiveCamera|perspective]] mode.
# '''Render:''' Select your project and press the {{Button|Render}} button in toolbar (also available from project's context menu).

'''And you should get a first rendering of your model.'''

More instructions can be found in the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render GitHub repository] or the online help.

== Features ==

Features include, but are not limited to:
* Lighting: point lights, area lights, sun-sky and preset lighting templates.
* Cameras.
* Material management (using usual shaders: matte, glossy, glass, principled etc.) including textures.
* Batch mode / UI mode.
* Denoiser.
* Halt condition (sample per pixel).
* Meshing control: angular and linear deflections, auto-smoothing.
