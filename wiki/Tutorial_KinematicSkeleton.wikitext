==Introduction== <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
This tutorial is about how to set up a simple 2D mechanism and attach 3D objects, mainly with the tools from the external [[Image:Assembly3_workbench_icon.svg|16px]] [[Assembly3_Workbench|Assembly3 Workbench]].

<!--T:4-->
This tutorial does not use the skeleton sketch principle (see Assembly3 [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Create-Skeleton-Sketch Create-Skeleton-Sketch] on GitHub).

<!--T:5-->
Instead we will use [[File:PartDesign_Body.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Bodies]] containing only one [[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketch]] each, to build a 2D mechanism, a '''multi sketch skeleton'''.

<!--T:6-->
The dimensions, and the colours as well, are taken from the [https://solvespace.com/linkage.pl SolveSpace tutorial] which is referred to on the Assembly3 GitHub page (see above).

==Multi sketch skeleton== <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
This so-called multi sketch skeleton consists of several individual [[File:PartDesign_Body.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Body|Bodies]] and an [[Image:Assembly_New_Assembly.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_CreateAssembly|Assembly]] container. To be able to attach further objects each body is put into a separate Assembly container.

===2D Body objects=== <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
The bodies, and their sketches, that are used in this assembly:
* A base plate (green)
* A crank (blue)
* Two movable plates (red and grey)
* Four connecting rods (white, yellow, purple, and brown)

<!--T:11-->
[[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-01.png|400px|link=]]
{{Caption|All eight sketches individually coloured and manually positioned by moving their parent bodies}}

<!--T:12-->
The shape can deviate from that of the real part, but the position of the joint defining geometry must be accurate.

===Assembly containers=== <!--T:13-->

====Parent assembly==== <!--T:14-->

<!--T:15-->
To fix or control the positions of all bodies we need an [[Image:Assembly_New_Assembly.svg‎‎|16px]] Assembly object. It adds an assembly branch to the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Assembly_New_Assembly.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_CreateAssembly|Create assembly]]}} button to create an assembly branch in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].

====Sub-assemblies==== <!--T:16-->

<!--T:17-->
Repeat above action to create an Assembly object for each Body and drag the Body into its Parts container. Then fix the Body to its Assembly:
# Activate the Assembly object (double-click).
# Select a circle/arc belonging the Body object.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Assembly_ConstraintLock.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintLock|Create "Locked" constraint]]}} button to fix the Body in its sub-assembly.

<!--T:18-->
The Crank-Assembly, for example, should look like this:

<!--T:19-->
[[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-25.png|500px|link=]]
{{Caption|The Crank's sub-assembly branch in the Tree view and the Crank with its locked Element in the 3D view}}

====Assembly tree==== <!--T:20-->

<!--T:21-->
In the Tree view drag all sub-assembly branches into the Parts container of the parent Assembly object.

<!--T:22-->
[[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-26.png|300px|link=]]
{{Caption|Assembly branch in the Tree view}}

<!--T:23-->
Now they are ready to be arranged.

===Fixed base plate=== <!--T:24-->

<!--T:25-->
First we need a fixed part. To fix the Base completely we would usually select a face, but in this case a circle will do as well.
# Select a circle of the Base.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Assembly_ConstraintLock.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintLock|Create "Locked" constraint]]}} button to fix the Base.

<!--T:26-->

{{Caption|Selected circle → Fixed Base with the created Element object and element coordinate system (ECS) displayed (green)}}

===Joints=== <!--T:27-->

<!--T:28-->
For hinge-like joints we select one circle of each sketch and use the [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintCoincidence.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintCoincidence|Plane Coincidence]] constraint. It not only sets both Element's XY planes coplanar, but sets their Z axes colinear, too.
# Select a circle of each object to connect.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Assembly_ConstraintCoincidence.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintCoincidence|Create "Plane Coincidence" constraint]]}} button. 

====Base - Crank==== <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->

{{Caption|Circles on Base and Crank selected → Relocated Crank with the created Element objects and ECSs displayed (green)}} 

====Base - Upper Plate==== <!--T:31-->

<!--T:32-->

{{Caption|Circles on Base and Upper Plate selected → Relocated Upper Plate}}

<!--T:33-->
Previously created joints can be identified by their constraint representations (red).

====Crank - Rod 1==== <!--T:34-->

<!--T:35-->

{{Caption|Circles on Crank and Rod 1 selected → Relocated Rod 1 and tilted Crank}}

====Upper Plate - Rod 1==== <!--T:36-->

<!--T:37-->
The last link in this kinematic chain connects two Elements whose Z directions are already defined and a [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintPointOnLine.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintPointOnLine|Point on line]] constraint is all we need.
# Select a circle of each object to connect.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Assembly_ConstraintPointOnLine.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintPointOnLine|Create "PointOnLine" constraint]]}} button.

<!--T:38-->

{{Caption|Circles on Upper Plate and Rod 1 selected → Relocated Rod 1, and tilted Crank and Upper Plate}}

<!--T:39-->
If the Z axes of three elements or joints are parallel and lie on the same virtual plane, the solver may fail to rearrange them in a following step because it is unable to decide in which direction the middle joint should be rotated. This can occur for the Rod 1 element, the Crank - Rod 1 joint, and the Base - Crank joint we have here. If this happens we need to help the solver and rotate one object (e.g. the Crank) manually using the [[Image:Assembly_AxialMove.svg|16px]] [[Assembly3_AxialMove|Axial move]] tool.

====Upper Plate - Rod 2==== <!--T:40-->

<!--T:41-->
Another kinematic (sub-)chain starts with [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintCoincidence.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintCoincidence|Plane Coincidence]] constraints.

<!--T:42-->
[[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-12.png|300px|link=]] [[Image:Button_right.svg|16px|link=]] [[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-13.png|300px|link=]]
{{Caption|Circles on Upper Plate (or Base) and Rod 2 selected → Relocated Rod 2}}

====Rod 2 - Lower Plate==== <!--T:43-->

<!--T:44-->

====Upper Plate - Rod 3==== <!--T:45-->

<!--T:46-->

{{Caption|Circles on Upper Plate and Rod 3 selected → Relocated Rod 3 and rearranged upper kinematic sub-chain}}

====Lower Plate - Rod 3==== <!--T:47-->

<!--T:48-->
And this kinematic (sub-)chain ends with a [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintPointOnLine.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintPointOnLine|Point on line]] constraint, too.

<!--T:49-->

{{Caption|Circles on Lower Plate and Rod 3 selected → Relocated Rod 3 and rearranged ukinematic sub-chains}}

<!--T:50-->
To connect both kinematic sub-chains we use Rod 4 with a [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintCoincidence.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintCoincidence|Plane Coincidence]] constraint on one end and a [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintPointOnLine.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintPointOnLine|Point on line]] constraint on the other.

====Crank - Rod 4==== <!--T:51-->

<!--T:52-->

{{Caption|Circles on Lower Plate and Rod 4 selected → Relocated Rod 4 and final layout of kinematic assembly}}

===Actuator=== <!--T:55-->

<!--T:56-->
Since Assembly3 doesn't provide any means to control kinematic assemblies, we need external assistance such as this [[Tutorial_KinematicController|kinematic controller]]. To use this controller we need to mark one constraint's label with the suffix {{Incode|"Driver"}} to make it a driving constraint. It may be separated by a {{Incode|"."}} or {{Incode|"-"}} for clarity, as the controller will only check if the label ends with {{Incode|"Driver"}}.

<!--T:57-->
We therefore change the label of the Base-Crank joint to {{Incode|Base-Crank.Driver}}.

===Finished skeleton=== <!--T:58-->

<!--T:59-->
The finished kinematic assembly with deactivated representation of Elements and Constraints should look like this:

<!--T:60-->
[[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-24.png|500px|link=]]
{{Caption|Finished assembly in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] and the [[3D_view|3D view]]}}

<!--T:61-->

{{Caption|GIF animation made from an image sequence from this [[Tutorial_KinematicController|kinematic controller]]}}

==Attaching 3D geometry== <!--T:62-->

<!--T:63-->
My expectations about attaching a new object to a base object belonging to a kinematic assembly were something like:
* Put the new object into the base object's Parts container.
* Position the new object in relation to the base object.
* Fix the relative offset and orientation using the Attachment constraint.
But that would have been too easy.


<!--T:64-->
The [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintAttachment.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintAttachment|Assembly3 ConstraintAttachment]] tool, like any Assembly3  constraint tool, relies on the use of Element objects and their element coordinate systems (ECSs) for positioning tasks. 

<!--T:65-->
And so attaching objects is just another way of adding objects to a (sub-)assembly.


<!--T:66-->
Let's attach Rod 4-3D to Rod 4 for example:

<!--T:67-->
The objects have a different orientation and the 3D object should have an offset from the 2D object.

<!--T:68-->
# Put the new object into the base object's Parts container.
# Select two corresponding circles or arcs.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Assembly_ConstraintAttachment.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintAttachment|Create "Attachment" constraint]]}} button.

<!--T:69-->
:[[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-28.png|200px|link=]] [[Image:Button_right.svg|16px|link=]] [[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-29.png|200px|link=]] [[Image:Button_right.svg|16px|link=]] [[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-30.png|200px|link=]]
{{Caption|Rod 4 (locked) and Rod 4-3D → Selected arcs → Relocated Rod 4-3D (both ECSs are in the same place with identical orientation)}}

<!--T:70-->
It is now plain to see that the [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintAttachment.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintAttachment|Assembly3 ConstraintAttachment]] tool ignores the offset and orientation between both objects.

<!--T:71-->
However the position is already defined as we wanted and so we only need to adapt the angle manually and define the desired offset:
* Set the {{PropertyData|Offset, Angle}} of the first Element in the Attachment container to match the orientation.
* Set the {{PropertyData|Offset, Position, z}} of the same Element to apply an offset.

<!--T:72-->
In case we set the properties of the second Element, the movement of angle and offset would go in the opposite direction.

{{Caption|As attached → Angle adapted → Offset defined}}

<!--T:73-->
If there is a 3D object attached to each 2D object, it could look like this:

<!--T:74-->
[[Image:Assembly3_SketchSkeleton-33.gif|500px|link=]]

==Notes== <!--T:75-->

<!--T:76-->
The section [[#Attaching_3D_geometry|Attaching 3D geometry]] just scratches the surface of extending a sub-assembly, and other constraints or combinations of constraints may be more suitable than the attachment constraint.

<!--T:77-->
It is important to move such a kinematic assembly in tiny steps or the solver will give up and fail. It is almost impossible to use [[Image:Assembly_Move.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_MovePart|Move part]] or [[Image:Assembly_AxialMove.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_AxialMove|Axial move]] for this task.

<!--T:78-->
The [[Image:Assembly_ConstraintCoincidence.svg‎‎|16px]] [[Assembly3_ConstraintCoincidence|Assembly3_ConstraintCoincidence]] constraint is used to drive the kinematic assembly, its property {{PropertyData|Angle}} (enabled by the property {{PropertyData|Lock Angle}}) accepts positive or negative floating point numbers greater than 360 and so could do several full turns.
