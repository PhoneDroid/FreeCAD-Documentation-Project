Development of FreeCAD 1.1 began after tagging [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/1.0.0 FreeCAD 1.0] on 19 November 2024.

=== Minimum supported library versions ===

No target release date has been set for version 1.1. Development continues to support the oldest currently-supported Ubuntu LTS version (20.04 LTS) until its support period expires in April 2025.

The minimum supported infrastructure software versions are therefore the ones of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:
* Boost 1.71
* GCC 9.3
* Clang 10.0
* CMake 3.16
* Python 3.8
* Qt 5.14
* OpenCASCADE 7.3
* VTK 6.3

This version of FreeCAD is compiled requiring the C++17 standard, and all C++17 features are allowed with one exception:
* std::regex is much slower than boost::regex in some important cases, so we will continue to include the Boost regex library

The developers are encouraged to review the [https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines C++ Core Guidelines] for modern C++ coding advice. No strict coding convention has been selected for FreeCAD, though new C++ code often conforms to the [https://wiki.qt.io/Coding_Conventions Qt coding conventions], and new Python typically conforms to [https://pep8.org/ PEP 8].
