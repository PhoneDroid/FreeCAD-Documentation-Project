== Introduction == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:2-->
In FreeCAD the word "[[Drawing|Drawing]]" is normally used to refer to a 2D projection of a [[model|3D model]]. This is usually created with the [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]].

==Usage== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
# Start with an already built [[model|3D model]], created with, for example, the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]]. In fact, any object that has a [[Shape|Shape]], including 2D objects, will work.
# Switch to the [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]].
# Press {{Button|[[File:TechDraw_PageDefault.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_PageDefault|TechDraw PageDefault]]}} or {{Button|[[File:TechDraw_PageTemplate.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_PageTemplate|TechDraw PageTemplate]]}} to create a Page.
# Select the existing model, and then press {{Button|[[File:TechDraw_View.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_View|TechDraw View]]}} or {{Button|[[File:TechDraw_ProjectionGroup.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_ProjectionGroup|TechDraw ProjectionGroup]]}}.
# A 2D projection on the page will be created. You may now adjust its properties, like {{PropertyData|Scale}}, {{PropertyData|Rotation}}, and {{PropertyData|Direction}}.
# When the drawing is ready, you can press {{Button|[[File:TechDraw_ExportPageSVG.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_ExportPageSVG|TechDraw ExportPageSVG]]}}, {{Button|[[File:TechDraw_ExportPageDXF.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_ExportPageDXF|TechDraw ExportPageDXF]]}}, or use [[Std_Export|Std Export]], to export the page to SVG, DXF, or PDF formats for further use in another software, or for printing.

== Notes == <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
In informal usage, a "Drawing" may be any geometrical figure that is visible in the [[3D_view|3D view]], and thus its concept may be confused with that of "[[Body|Body]]", "[[Part|Part]]", or "[[Model|model]]".

<!--T:7-->
However, when more precision is required, the distinction must be made.
* A "[[Body|Body]]" ([[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]]) is an object derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class), created with the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].
* A "[[Part|Part]]" ([[App_Part|App Part]]) is used to group several "[[Body|Bodies]]" to form an assembly.
* A "Drawing" is a 2D projection of a "Body" or a "Part".
