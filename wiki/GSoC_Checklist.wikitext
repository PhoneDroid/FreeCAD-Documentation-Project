Below is a checklist to help students get set up quickly.  Items are categorized to help you prepare your application, get set up to work, and become familiarized with basic infrastructure.

=== Applying ===

# Check out our [[Google_Summer_of_Code_2024#Implementation_Ideas|Project Ideas]]
# Introduce yourself! Don't be shy. The main place where the FreeCAD community meets is the [https://forum.freecad.org FreeCAD forum]. Create yourself an account, introduce yourself, and tell a bit about what you would like to do with FreeCAD or ask for ideas. You can post for example under the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=8 Open discussion] section or the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46 GSoC] section.
# Begin your application, see [[GSoC Application Guidelines]]
# See proposal ideas on the [[Google Summer of Code 2024]] page, or make up your own idea!
# Discuss and share your project details on the forum (don't wait, the sooner the better your proposal can be!)
# [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ Submit your application]
# Wait for the results

=== When you get selected ===

# Read the BRL-CAD [https://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Acceptance requirements]and [https://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Expectations expectations]. FreeCAD is not applying under the BRL-CAD umbrella anymore, but we still follow the same guidelines and ways of doing. We will request that you commit to your work, and communicate often.
# Set up an interaction schedule with your mentors
# Get familiarized with web resources: [https://freecad.org Homepage], [https://wiki.freecad.org Wiki], [https://forum.freecad.org Forum]
# Post your proposal online. Create a thread for your project under the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46 GSoC forum].
# Describe your project plan
# Document a list of 3 to 10 milestones
# Announce your plan on the forum
# Download or clone the source code, and make sure you are able to compile FreeCAD successfully (compile, install, run) [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD Source] & [[Compiling]]

=== Once coding begins ===

# Write maintainable, portable, complete code
# Keep a '''daily''' log of your activities on your forum thread
# Provide a midterm report on your project progress to your forum thread
# Stay motivated, engage other devs, allocate time for discussions
# Provide a final report on your project progress to the mailing list
# Keep working on FreeCAD :-)
# Submit patches to get familiarized with code; find small tasks [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22 like these]
