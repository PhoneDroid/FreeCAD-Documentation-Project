Below is a checklist to help students get set up quickly.  Items are categorized to help you prepare your application, get set up to work, and become familiarized with basic infrastructure.

=== Applying ===

# Check out our [[Google_Summer_of_Code_2025#Implementation_Ideas|Project Ideas]]
# Create yourself an account on the [https://forum.freecad.org FreeCAD forum]
# Make also sure you have a [https://github.com GitHub account] (not 100% required, but it will be useful to submit your code)
# Introduce yourself! Don't be shy. Tell a bit about what you would like to do with FreeCAD or ask for ideas. You can post for example under the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=8 Open discussion] section or, better, directly in the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46 GSoC section]
# Begin your application, see [[GSoC Application Guidelines]]
# Discuss and share your project details on the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46 GSoC section] of the forum (don't wait, the sooner the better your proposal can be!)
# [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ Submit your application]
# Wait for the results

=== Things to know before applying ===

# If you are selected, we will attribute two mentors to you. These mentors will help you to navigate through the code and the FreeCAD universe, but you are the one responsible for doing your work and keeping up to the schedule.

=== When you get selected ===

# Read the BRL-CAD [https://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Acceptance requirements]and [https://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Expectations expectations]. FreeCAD is not applying under the BRL-CAD umbrella anymore, but we still follow the same guidelines and ways of doing. We will request that you commit to your work, and communicate often.
# Set up an interaction schedule with your mentors
# Get familiarized with web resources: [https://freecad.org Homepage], [https://wiki.freecad.org Wiki], [https://forum.freecad.org Forum]
# Post your proposal online. Create a thread for your project under the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46 GSoC forum].
# Describe your project plan
# Document a list of 3 to 10 milestones
# Announce your plan on the forum
# Download or clone the source code, and make sure you are able to compile FreeCAD successfully (compile, install, run) [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD Source] & [[Compiling]]

=== Once coding begins ===

# Write maintainable, portable, complete code
# Keep a '''daily''' log of your activities on your forum thread
# Provide a midterm report on your project progress to your forum thread
# Stay motivated, engage other devs, allocate time for discussions
# Provide a final report on your project progress to the mailing list
# Keep working on FreeCAD :-)
# Submit patches to get familiarized with code; find small tasks [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22 like these]
